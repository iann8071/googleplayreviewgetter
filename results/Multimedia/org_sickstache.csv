5,Very well done. There isn't anything else like it.
5,Thanks so much!!! This works great! Now I don't have to leave my couch!
5,Excellent app! Great UI! works very well +1 for the developer having this kept as free. Really nice way to review all upcoming TV shows including managing the status for each one, and seeing fore-coming episodes in a nice clean view.
5,Sick! This app is clean, simple, and perfect!
3,Bummer It doesn't seem to work with the pirate Bay fork, so not much use to me sadly. Just says error retrieving results, error null.
1,Won't connect Sadly, it force closes every time I put the API in. Never once connected.
5,Perfect. Clean. Slick. User friendly. Never have to leave the couch.
5,Amazing Does exactly what it should do. I used to remote in to check my shows and add new ones but now I don't have to. Great job.
