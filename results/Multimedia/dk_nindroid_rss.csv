5,Wonderful Works great on my HTC One. Great app. Highly recommended.
5,Easily the best Why is this free, seriously the amount of charged for rubbish available and the best app is free. So many settings and options available it's well worth taking some time to get to know what it can do. Awesome app and much kudos and thanks to Mark.

1,used to love this but can't see images on SD card I loved floating image on my S2, but on my S4 I can't figure out how to change the path to camera images from the default to the SD card. I've clicked around a lot but not managed it yet - can you tell me how? It was my favourite live wallpaper.
