5,Great! Exactly what I was looking for, even built-in support for streaming! Can't seem to run the app in the background though, the streaming stops then?
4,Looks great Tried this app to connect to music box for raspberry pi (linked to Spotify) as I wasn't to keen on their web interface. It works pretty well but it won't load songs lists for any album. It can play any of my predefined playlists though. If it could do this it would definitely be 5 star. Good work looks great.
