4,Excellent, but lacks app support. I'd like to control spotify with this remote, but there's no support for apps (yet?)
4,Nice improvements Much nicer but no song select actions work when clicking a song in my music folder after changing it in the settings menu to any value other than "none"
5,Well done Better than the "official" App
