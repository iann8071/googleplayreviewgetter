3,Works but needs some UX attention E.g. sync icons showing on all synced entries instead of just the ones waiting to be synced, some way to search for the intersections of tags, and so on.
3,Solid, but needs attention to UI This is a decent app but it suffers from glitches and a very rudimentary interface. For example, when reading a bookmark using the Instapaper viewer, rotating your device will cause the page to reload, losing your place. A few well-placed pixels and some smoother interactions would go a long way towards making this good app a great one.
