4,Good app. Bad update Love this app, but the new update crashes on launch. Thanks. The update to the update fixed the crash.
3,Fullfeatured but VERY SLOW and buggy At least for a reasonably big list of feeds
4,Excellent Fills all my requirements and is updated frequently, with care for the users. Thanks a lot!
5,This + TTRSS = AWESOME! This was a 5 star but reduced to 3. EDIT: Back up to 5 stars again! Can now disable the split screen so it's usable again on phone and tablet. Keep up the great work! So glad Google Reader closed down, much better running my own!
5,Not perfect, but does the job adequately with a private instance of tt-rss server
