3,Ok Doesn't display streamed mp4 video in the correct aspect ratio on Nexus 7 2013 LTE (deb). Displays correctly on Note 2 (i605).
3,cannot play embedded videos i cant play videos from streaming sites coz it says that the format is not supported..is it for security purposes that it is disallowed? i tried chrome browser and it played just fine..because of this limitation i would have to switch browsers whenever i want to play videos from sites..i hope you will extend your video support.
