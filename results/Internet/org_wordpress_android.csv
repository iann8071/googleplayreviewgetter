1,Ruins posts. It deletes the brackets on HTML tags. Like, what the frak? That makes the app completely useless. It posts big walls of text that resembles HTML instead of images. Samsung Galaxy S4
1,If only... When I first used this app it was perfect for my needs. Then one day it stopped uploading my posts. And since that day my posts have stayed local to the device, which rather defies the point of blogging. I've tried everything I can think of to fix it but nothing works. So this is a one star rating for the problem and for the lack of support to find a solution :(
2,Stats issues Newest update seems to cache stats for way to long, I cant see today's till tomorrow
