1,This was the best app... But then... It ruined all my logs from my flying days in Turkey this October. Now all of them are useless. I can upload only one at a time. The next one has to replace the other one because it has not only the sam date, but the same exact time. More than 15 flights, all with year 1999. So disappointed.
5,Better than most commercial flying instruments.
