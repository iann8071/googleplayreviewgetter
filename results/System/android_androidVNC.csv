5,Works As Advertised I rarely give reviews on Google Play, because most apps just don't impress me all that much. This is one of those apps that does exactly as advertised, and does it very well. I can't think of any complaints, although there could be features missing that some people want, it has everything that I need.
1,Too slow on 3g. This does no compression apparently when on 3g AT ALL which makes it virtually useless unless on wifi 5 feet away.
5,Tricky at first. Being a long time VNC user this is a very cool app. It takes some fiddling with to get set up properly but after that works very well. It would rate 6 stars if it had the File Transfer and Chat features. If you have trouble just follow the wiki for this until you get it working right.
5,Nearly perfect Pretty flawless. My only complaint would be the Send Text implementation. Wish I could just pop up the keyboard and type, including bksp. Maybe its a setting I haven't discovered yet?
3,Would give it 5 starts... ...but the inability to send a double-click without changing input modes (no, i don't have a trackball or a dpad to double-click it) makes it totally inconvenient for me :-(
