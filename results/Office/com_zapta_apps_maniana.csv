5,Simple, easy, perfect I have used this app to run my life for several months. Love it's simplicity and the ability to put things off as well as get things done. Never any problems. Thanks
5,Best To Do App This is the best To Do app I've ever used. Graphics are cool & the app itself is simple & easy. I highly recommend this one.
5,Adaptable, Colourful, & Easy! Very nice programme! You have used all the things I love about "Do It Tomorrow" (by Adylitica) and added some really delightful, user customizable features, including color & sound.  I also like how the font & size can be adjusted on the app as well as its widget. And since I love novelty & immediate gratification...the randomly chosen positive reinforcement sounds for completed tasks (i.e. clapping) are a real kick! I'll really enjoy using this!
5,Clearly The Best! This is the best to-do-list app I could find for Android. I especially like how easily you can do voice recognition entries. Personally I would love to be able to create more lists though, e.g. an 'Upcoming' and a 'Someday' list like in Any.do, and a 'Shopping list' would be great too! Thank you for this really nice really free app!
5,I absolutely love this ap! It's simple, cute, and gets to the point. I love how easy it is to use and organize. I do have a suggestion- could you please make a feature/button that picks a random task for you from the list? It would make doing tasks more interesting and fun! Thank you so much for this ap
5,Wonderful app! Very ready to use, simple, better than any of the others I've tried.
5,Very nice! Good job... super cool app.
5,Typically I don't review... ..but I LOVE this app! I got a new phone and realized how lost I was without it. Thanks for making a great app.
5,Very Nice Perfect.. nothing to add. Please don't add stupid reminders.
5,Very cute ,it's a perfect to-do-list apps Thank you so much!
4,One of the best The only thing I'd love to have added would be time based reminders.
4,Simple usefull Great to do list
5,Simple and easy Was looking for something not too complicated, the equivalent of having a piece of paper and writing down things to do...this was perfect!
5,thank you so much thank you so much !!! it's verry helpful ! i love it !!!!!!!
5,Superb perfectly fits to my expectations:-)
5,So far..... So good. I love that you can customize the hell out of it to go with your theme. I also love the uncomplicated feel of everything. This is my perfect to do app. Search complete!!! After playing around with the app... I have 1 suggestion/request... Subtasks...
5,Great! After being hustled by a vendor that provides the same procrastination features but asks money for every feature inside the app (!), using this app is a huge advancement. Widgets that are free and come in all shapes, nice presentation, even landscape is supported.
5,Great app Free widget=great app. Tried using Do It Tomorrow and found out that i have to pay to get the widget. Why would i pay for a widget when this app provides it for free! Thanks to the creator.
5,Brilliant My new favourite To-Do app. It's simple, elegant, and I love the customisation options. Strange advertising video and ugly icon are the only things I would change. The app itself is near perfect
5,need more colors for marks and double tap action It's nice app, great work! But can you create more colors for marks in popup dialog, default color and mark as completed by double or triple tap action? Need also bigger buttons at bottom and new note by tap on empty space. Thanks!
