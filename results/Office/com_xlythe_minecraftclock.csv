5,Awesome Love the clock, I've made it my only clock. Would be cool if you can do a minecraft compass.
5,Works well. The clock seems to be accurate, but however the clock only comes in one size for me, 1x1, and there's no way to change it. I'm running gingerbread, if that helps. Otherwise, it works just fine and it looks nice. Edit: Also the circle doesn't quite fit in the clock, I can see the edge of it. Really un-minecrafty. Please fix! I have LG Optimus Q. Double edit: It works perfectly fine now, still don't have extra sizes, but it looks very good.
5,Cool app This app is for you if you absolutely love minecraft! The clock works fantastically and I have absolutely no problems at all.

5,Update It's working now! All I had to do was wait. But now it works and it's so cool! it is 100% accurate to real time.
