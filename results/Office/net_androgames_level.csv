5,Great handy tool Easy to use. Great to have this handy gadget around. May not be 100% perfect but good enough for me.
4,Horz works great! The horizontal level works great...! Very accurate when comparing with other physical levels. But as others say, vertical level is way off, and impossible to calibrate on Nexus 4.
5,Dead on at install Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 - Android 4.3 I knew as soon as I turned this app on that it was accurate as decades of engineering and design have heightened my sense of "horizontal". Great app that will be super handy in the field, esp with the readout showing 1/10 of a degree accuracy. I don't mean to flame the "Calibration whiners", but come on. If you live in even a semi-new home just lay the thing on the bathroom counter to calibrate it (as one person already pointed out, most professional installed surfaces are already level.) If you just want to hang pictures here is a tip.. calibrate it by using the wall... if the wall is crooked and your pictures straight then it will show. :] Meanwhile, you should only have to calibrate it once. I also suspect that people who yell that it is way off just have bad sensors because the app is solid!
5,Johnny on the spot! A friend first showed me this app on his iPhone. I now have it installed on my Samsung Note Android device. It's simple, it's easy, its free, and it works flawlessly. I freaking love it!
4,Needs calibrate first This thing surprisingly accurate. Only con is it needs a reminder to calibrate upon first use.
5,Great app It works great on my mini droid, so simple but very good at what it does. Easy to calibrate and set up.
4,Very good Do what it is supposed to do in a wonderful and simple way, I love it :-).
1,Woow... My teacher once said, "A calculator is only as smart as the man using it". Meaning if you don't know to use it then it becomes useless to you. I downloaded this app while holding up a heavy corkboard in hopes of nailing it the wall. Needless to say I was unable to calibrate it so it became useless to me. A lil frustrating holding up something large & heavy! Leason learned & would not recomend this app!!
3,Does not work for vertical surfaces On nexus 4, when measuring vertical surfaces (portrait mode), incorrectly uses both accelerometers, which makes it impossible to level, even after calibration. It should only use one of the accelerometers in this mode, or use a better calculation. On the other hand, works perfectly for horizontal surfaces (landscape and surface modes).
4,Works great you'll love it Very accurate,love it,use it all the time.
2,Hmmm... Trying to use the standard bubble level with the volume control on one side of my phone wasn't easy, and the two readings when laying the phone flat (circle) were rather complicated too. Uninstalled it.
5,Excellent Not quite a master machinist level :-) but more sensitive than a torpedo level. And yes, the price is right, too.
5,A handy app which works well Have used this on several devices. Not perfect - not quite as accurate on some surfaces as an actual spirit level but the fact that it is always with me makes up for limitations.
5,Works Very Well Works very well and ensures that I always have a level on hand when setting up my caravan, I love the "Ding" when you get everything level. Recommended and with no excessive permissions it is a must have app. HTC One XL with Android 4.0.4
5,Simple measurement tool Uses the gyroscope to measure level. Does no less than a real bubble measure, assuming your phone's sensors work!
1,App require perfectly level surface for calibration If I need this app I probably don't have a real level which means I won't be able to know if a surface is truly level. Rendering this app totally useless. Also the default calibration is completely off. You can tell just by looking at it!
5,Nice Just a level checker. No less, no more. And works really accurate.
5,I like comprehensive yet simple application, commercial-free like me want to donate lol
5,Great simple app Great for when I had to throw some shelves up last minute and forgot where I stored my level. Quick download and works great! Thanks!
5,Simple application that does one thing well No questionable permissions required = 5 stars. I only use it for leveling horizontal surfaces. Vertical mode seems to be broken on Nexus 4.
3,ISW11K DIGNO 使えました。小数点以下を表示させたり、表示させ無かったり出来ます。角度以外の表示（坂道の％表示の様なの）も有ります。ただ、タイムラグが最小値にしても大き過ぎ。動作がトロい。
4,キャリブレーションすれば使える インストールしたままだと結構ずれてるけど、水準器に合わせてキャリブレーションしたら使えるようになりました。
5,頼もしいです。 写真関連の仕事をしていますが、本当の水準器と比べてみましたがあまり変わらず、これだけでも事足りてしまいそう。 ただ、スマホが立たないので不便はありますが大まかな水平は出せることに感激です。 ＣＭが出ないのも嬉しいですね！
5,こんなの探してました 英語なのは残念ですけど、試せばわかるのでよし。便利ですね。
5,便利 色々役立つ。精度もいい。
3,良かったら 日本語で説明してほしいな〜！
5,シンプルで良い
5,使いたい時にココにある便利さ。 一家に一つある物でもなし、でも使いたい時がたまにある。センサーの精度に依存はするけど、家庭で使うには十分実用的。
5,こういうのが本当の無料アプリ 最低限の機能とちょっと寂しいUI 怪しいアクセス無し
5,端末のセンサーの出来に依存するけど、0点リセットできるし、キャリブレーションもできるので、使いやすい。
3,IS03ですが、エコモードにすると横の表示でバブルの位置がおかしいバグがあります。 あと、ロックも機能しない。
4,他の水準器アプリと違って、インターネットへのアクセス権を要求しないのは嬉しい。
4,ぱっと使えるのがイイ。T-01Cのカメラの出っ張り分が多少気になるけど…。
3,絶妙なズレがありましたがかならり役に立つように思います。若干のズレはたぶん個体差があると思います。galaxyＳ
0,全然精度が出ていません。
5,炊飯器でお米の水を測る時に毎日役立っています！
5,飾り棚を壁に取り付ける時に 役立ちました。
4,結構便利！
5,水平とりまくるぜ(笑)
4,I can't determine which sensor I should use between orientation sensor and ... I can't determine which sensor I should use between orientation sensor and accelometer.
