5,Great handy tool Easy to use. Great to have this handy gadget around. May not be 100% perfect but good enough for me.
4,Horz works great! The horizontal level works great...! Very accurate when comparing with other physical levels. But as others say, vertical level is way off, and impossible to calibrate on Nexus 4.
5,Dead on at install Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 - Android 4.3 I knew as soon as I turned this app on that it was accurate as decades of engineering and design have heightened my sense of "horizontal". Great app that will be super handy in the field, esp with the readout showing 1/10 of a degree accuracy. I don't mean to flame the "Calibration whiners", but come on. If you live in even a semi-new home just lay the thing on the bathroom counter to calibrate it (as one person already pointed out, most professional installed surfaces are already level.) If you just want to hang pictures here is a tip.. calibrate it by using the wall... if the wall is crooked and your pictures straight then it will show. :] Meanwhile, you should only have to calibrate it once. I also suspect that people who yell that it is way off just have bad sensors because the app is solid!
5,Johnny on the spot! A friend first showed me this app on his iPhone. I now have it installed on my Samsung Note Android device. It's simple, it's easy, its free, and it works flawlessly. I freaking love it!
4,Needs calibrate first This thing surprisingly accurate. Only con is it needs a reminder to calibrate upon first use.
5,Great app It works great on my mini droid, so simple but very good at what it does. Easy to calibrate and set up.
4,Very good Do what it is supposed to do in a wonderful and simple way, I love it :-).
1,Woow... My teacher once said, "A calculator is only as smart as the man using it". Meaning if you don't know to use it then it becomes useless to you. I downloaded this app while holding up a heavy corkboard in hopes of nailing it the wall. Needless to say I was unable to calibrate it so it became useless to me. A lil frustrating holding up something large & heavy! Leason learned & would not recomend this app!!
3,Does not work for vertical surfaces On nexus 4, when measuring vertical surfaces (portrait mode), incorrectly uses both accelerometers, which makes it impossible to level, even after calibration. It should only use one of the accelerometers in this mode, or use a better calculation. On the other hand, works perfectly for horizontal surfaces (landscape and surface modes).
4,Works great you'll love it Very accurate,love it,use it all the time.
2,Hmmm... Trying to use the standard bubble level with the volume control on one side of my phone wasn't easy, and the two readings when laying the phone flat (circle) were rather complicated too. Uninstalled it.
5,Excellent Not quite a master machinist level :-) but more sensitive than a torpedo level. And yes, the price is right, too.
5,A handy app which works well Have used this on several devices. Not perfect - not quite as accurate on some surfaces as an actual spirit level but the fact that it is always with me makes up for limitations.
5,Works Very Well Works very well and ensures that I always have a level on hand when setting up my caravan, I love the "Ding" when you get everything level. Recommended and with no excessive permissions it is a must have app. HTC One XL with Android 4.0.4
5,Simple measurement tool Uses the gyroscope to measure level. Does no less than a real bubble measure, assuming your phone's sensors work!
1,App require perfectly level surface for calibration If I need this app I probably don't have a real level which means I won't be able to know if a surface is truly level. Rendering this app totally useless. Also the default calibration is completely off. You can tell just by looking at it!
5,Nice Just a level checker. No less, no more. And works really accurate.
5,I like comprehensive yet simple application, commercial-free like me want to donate lol
5,Great simple app Great for when I had to throw some shelves up last minute and forgot where I stored my level. Quick download and works great! Thanks!
5,Simple application that does one thing well No questionable permissions required = 5 stars. I only use it for leveling horizontal surfaces. Vertical mode seems to be broken on Nexus 4.
5,very nice very helpful ,simple ,doesn't consume a large space in the memory great job. 5 stars.
5,Helped a friend move a pool table, didn't bring a level for leveling the ... Helped a friend move a pool table, didn't bring a level for leveling the table. With this app and a few newspapers we were playing a game in no time. This app is wonderful. I do carpentry, and for me, didn't have any issues. LG Optimus 38c. Anyone who says it isn't accurate is what the french call ignorant.
5,Simply the best... and accurate. Forgot to bring a level on a TV install job and was lucky to find this! Works great and very simple.
5,Simple and honest Any app that doesn't require full internet access always 5 stars from me, and it works well.
5,Works well Simple and effective. Can't ask for much more.
5,Epic Small, easy, well made, no ads, no evil permissions. This is very good stuff.
3,Might need tweaking... Does what it says on the tin, but it doesn't seem particularly responsive. I was trying to level a bookcase, and it never seemed to want to move from its initial reading. But I got close enough, so I can't fault the app too much!
3,LG P880 poor accuracy Works fairly well on the back of the phone but useless on vertical surfaces. Never settles even on solid level stone worktop so calibration suspect.
3,To twitchy The bubble moves even when the phone is stationary. Not very useful. Off to buy a 2 dollar torpedo level.
4,Wow...Great App! I compared it to the "real" level. MATCH! Living in a camper...I use my phone for everything! To save space!
5,I Great Tool This is the only one that worked on my pmid705. I have tried 3 others that did not work at all despite the highest in class ratings. I Kudos!
5,Great ! This saved my day when puting up a washingmachine. Most of my day went looking for analog level. When I found this. Flash of genious! Thanks!
5,Works This helped me put up a poster in my room. Looks perfect :)
5,Great! Used it to adjust my washing machine's feet. Now it doesn't shake anymore! Thank you :)
1,Obviously off First time using it to hang a set of coathooks and the app was obviously off. Better job using my eye. Lovely interface, but what's the point if I have to calibrate just to use it?
5,Simple, does what it says. No frills, just a level tool!
5,I like it I wish my phone was flat so would work better.
5,Works good This app is fun to mess with I have opened it up and had people rolling laughing. But they are amazed it works for light jobs lol.
5,Just what I need Nothing more or less. No nonsense permissions surrendered. Oh little hint to those who don't know how to calibrate. Most professionally installed surfaces have already been leveled. Wink wink
5,Awesome!! This app fix my accelerometer!!(needs reboot after calibrate)
5,Works well I've been using it I all devices for years and love it
5,Pure gold What it says works as accurate as your phone can be. Tested with real levels and has always worked. I use to level thermostats. One less tool I have to have in my bag. :)
5,Cool and simple Simplicity rules. Has two different style bubble levels.
3,Does not work in portrait mode On Droid RAZR Maxx the bubble never stabilizes in portrait mode. Works well in landscape mode and when placed flat.
5,Very good Works great! Now if only I could find an app to dig the post-holes for me...
5,Love it Almost as good as the real thing. Actually it's better.
5,Pretty Handy It's very useful. Thanks!
5,Serves it's purpose well This app does what it's supposed to without a cluttered interface, ads, or suspicious permissions. Highly recommended.
5,Level Not got many tools at home, so really helpful.
5,Galaxy Note 3 Nice app! I use this to help level my pictures when i hang them!
5,Accurate, works well Does exactly what it needs to and looks good. No crashes or bugs.
5,Love it! Simple interface. Did exactly what it says. Didn't need to calibrate for simple picture hanging.
4,Good Tool Works well, however, with one minor flaw. When used in portrait rotation, the angle readout seems to be double what the actual value is. Planar and landscape modes seem to report correctly.
5,Useful Thank you, has helped with many projects!
5,It is great! As an Aeronautical Engineer, it is essential to calculate how an surface is with respect to another.
5,Works like a charm! Every time! =) Perfect!
1,Crap It's a piece of junk! Way way off! Nice try and all but I'll stay old school forever now!
3,It just works Much better than using your eye.
5,Great A must to have
1,Terrible Tried to use this to level a shelf I was putting in a closet, and it's nowhere close to being accurate. Now I have to redo the whole thing.
5,perfect. No more and no less than what I needed. No ads, no retarded permissions. Now this is a well made app.
5,Got exactly what I expected Very happy with this app.
5,Great !!! A super little app. Accurate as well !!!!
5,Perfect little app Does what it claims to do with zero effort.
5,I seldom do a job that needs anything more precise than this. Does make ... I seldom do a job that needs anything more precise than this. Does make me wonder how level the edge of my phone is... Great app!
4,Works really well! I haven't used all the features yet, but I hung a few picture frames using the horizontal level yesterday and was very satisfied.
5,Perfect Does what I need and doesn't require any rediculous access. Thank you.
5,Coolest App On Google Play Positives - Everything Negatives - Nothing I would give this app 500 stars if I could. Coolest app I've ever used.
5,Perfect Thanks for not needing any special permissions!
5,Works well for determining roof pitch and matched my 48" level for accuracy too!
2,Contradicts actual level I tried using it to level my camper but the 360Åã bubble moved like molasses even when adjusted in settings. It never agreed with an actual bubble level which I'd set on the face of my note 2. Sorry!
5,Easy and accurate Calibration was great upon install on Samsung Note 3. Simple to use.
3,Basically good I'm not positive when upright the bubble is inverted.
5,Works perfect No ads just does its job well. This is a good developer. 1 of my favourite he always gets back to u if u have any question.
5,Totally awesome I love how it automatically changes the level type based on orientation.
5,Perfect Does what it is supposed to do. Good job dev!
4,Love it! Use it to level out our camper.
5,Great work Its really handy I love it
5,Use it lots I use this all the time when levelling the caravan. Handy
5,Cool App! Very useful in leveling my newly bought abstract paintings!
5,Simple, good Not the level you want to depend on, but if your torpedo isn't in your bags, it'll do in a pinch.
5,Awesome app! Great and handy tool to have!
5,Simple and effective I mostly use it to hang pictures and so on, but it's a handy tool I always have with me.
5,Good Good work! No bulls... once you calibrate it from a real level you can rely on this app with confidence.
3,Nice app Works well make sure u calibrate it
5,VERY GOOD Actually I appreciate the professionality of the programmer No strange permissions are required by this program and it does the job
5,Indispensable. Must have and simple to use.
5,Excellent. Works. No bloat Thank you for developing this great app!
5,Very cool & handy for quick checks. Thanks
5,Good App Simple and works very well on my Galaxy S3 i9300.
4,Pretty good app. Looks nice. Does its job. Sometimes you have to wiggle the phone to get it to catch up with small changes.
5,Good. Multiple levels and ways to use them
4,Good but Doesn't work in landscape mode
5,Handy and very useful Now all my pictures are level and it is much easier to level the RV, as well.

5,Very good Simple and accurate
5,Great little app for DIY Worked as required. Very handy for hanging pictures and mounting tv's
5,Great tool Simple to use and works great!

5,Clear and simple Does exactly what it should and is clear to read
5,Just what I needed ... And doesn't crash like another spirit level app I tried!
5,Perfect Well, I checked it with my real life level" and the accuracy is perfect.
5,Perfect Does just what It's supposed to :)
5,Cool App Works fine
5,Simple but great app This app is really simple but it does exactly what it says. It also has a really good design and responds very quickly.
5,No special permissions now thats my kind of app thank you. Need this for a project my physical level is at the shop! Thanks for a quality app.
1,If I could give it a zero I would Even after calibration, it still didn't level adequately
5,Great Does what it says on the tin. Works well - no problems.
3,Not Accurate Not bad but not accurate
5,Great app! Works well, and doesn't require any intrusive permissions. 5 stars!
5,Great Awesome very accurate works better without phone case
5,Simple and Effective! It works great!
5,Very nice It helped me a lot!
5,Superb! But eco-mode messes measuring in landscape!

5,Shop foreman Great app, very accurate. ...
1,Never used How about an s3 curved level? No

5,Perfect. Simple and ad-free. Does not require any uneccesary permissions.
5,Works great. Simple interface. Does exactly what it is supposed to do.
5,Functional Does what it is supposed to. Lone the multi-directional capability.
4,I give it a4 star Good
5,Great It's refreshing to see "no special permissions required". And the app works pretty well too. If you need 0.1Åã tolerance then buy a proper tool.
5,Simple and useful Not much more to say.
2,broken, immobile bubble On my phone, bubble stays fixed when the phone is on one side. Pretty non-functional...
4,Pretty cool, can be handy in a pinch.
5,webster good and light, tnx

5,Nice app! Has came in handy a few times
1,Bullshit!! My shelves look COMPLETELY FUCKED.
3,Not the best Would like to be able to calibrate seperatly
5,Save your day Great free app Thanks

3,Good Good to have even though I never use it :/

5,waao v. nice
5,Cool app Levelling life
5,Excellent Very good tool

3,Works But how do you now the place you use to calibrate it is level?
5,Works and no funky permissions Need I say more?
5,Excellent tool

5,Very handy and useful
5,Saved the day This works so well. Extremely easy to use. 123
5,Great App! This app does what it is supposed to do, it's handy to have at your fingertips, and it doesn't bother you with obnoxious advertisements. I just hope the developer can figure out a way to put my circular saw into an app!
1,Sucks and useless I had tested with 3 separate levels to check on the levelness of my pictures while I was hanging them. They all showed perfectly level. Than I checked it with this tool, and off level. This app sucks and it's pretty much useless!
1,Battery drain Required update caused my batt to drain. Delete app until I need it then download again then delete the hassle is worth having battery
5,Great! Delicious and nutritious. Thank you.
5,Love it! Its ronseal. No unnecessary permissions, and works great. Lesson to others
5,Just works. I recently moved and used this app to hang everything in my apartment. I love it. Depending on how you hold your phone it will switch to different kinds of levels. Handy and accurate.
5,Great tool
1,Plain (plane, haha) useless on tablet Useless on my tablet. It's always 90 degrees out of alignment with the screen direction. If I lock it to be oriented correctly with the screen, the bubble is at on end or the other. Unlocked it always turns itself vertical but reads 90 degrees with the bubble in the middle. Pure carp.
4,Works good
5,This is the best tool on my phone I love the fact this has both bullseye and vial levels! The fact that it switches between the two automatically is awesome when your hands are busy holding your work. This is the best tool app I've seen and AD free is the icing on the cake.
5,Bubble Level Very precise!
3,Still won't lock Ads now gone. Still doesn't lock
5,Does what it says on the tin! Perfect
5,Great tool. Thank you. Use it almost every day.
5,Awesome Fantastic little app. Does what it says and does it well.
4,Very useful! A necessary and obviously useful tool. Thanks!
5,Great! I use it all the time instead of looking for a big level. Thank you for this handy app.
5,Great Cool
2,Disappointing After a long search among free levelers that do not require any funny permissions I considered this one as one of the best, and installed it to try it out. However, while fiddling with its settings, I tried to go set "Display Type" to "Inclination" and it froze on me. After that, it was freezing every time I tried to go into settings. So, I had to go and clear the application data. Then, I realized that it is not all that accurate either in "Orientation" or in "Accelerometer" sensor mode, and this is not due to my phone, because another app (also called "Bubble") is perfectly accurate. So, I am sorry, but I did not find this app to be any good.
5,Very awesome and useful Love this app. I used to stop my friend complaining that the pool table at the wasn't level.
5,RVing made easy Made setting up my tent trailer a snap. Since they have room be perfectly level to go up straight! Love it
4,Work well, does what it says and easy to use. Overall a solid app.
5,Superb App! This will be really handy for DIY people like me! :)
5,Great in a pinch Completely forgot a level 5 hours away and needed to install in a new apartment, great app as long a you have a nice flat surface.
5,MVS Warren This is a very useful app. I install gates and security systems. I use it a lot. My clients get a kick out of it when I pull my phone out and turn on the level. Very pleased.
5,Awesome Just calibrate before using. You can do that grime the menu in the app. Perfect in every way. Just used to prove my Wife wrong. :-)
5,Great app Used the app to mount my tv on the wall. Saved myself $15!!
5,Works great for me I use this to level my trailer after parking. I also use it to set the elevation angle on satellite antennas.
5,It works. Nothing here that will amaze or inspire, but there doesn't need to be. This app functions correctly, is intuitive, and stable.
5,Exactly what I needed Great app. It does exactly what it says.
5,Free. ACCURATE WOW! Thank you for not having ads
5,What's not to like Nice work. Nice easy to use app. Thanks
4,Works It works but only as good as the calibration and how well you can balance your phone on an object.
4,Works good The only thing it needs is a way to lock the pitch reading when measuring roof pitch over your head and you can't read the screen because of the glare
5,Great Tool I work in architecture and find myself using this cool app on construction sites checking various materials installed around buildings. Took the place of me carrying a pocket size level around with me since I always carry my phone. Droid 4
3,Xperia U just crap Possibly working fine on other devices
4,Bubble leveler Simple and nice! Works great also.
5,Superb Handy and useful application.
4,Useful Not always convinced on total accuracy,may just be my phone config tho.
4,Great I have this app on my tablet and its very useful. I like the way the level changes to a circle when i lay the tablet flat so i can check level on two planes at once.
5,Just what I need Simple, elegant and fun to use
5,Great app! I have a set of front load washer and dryer. I purchased the pedestal drawers for them and used the app to level them, it worked flawlessly! Thank you!
5,Superb I actually used this to level a machine when the standard level had leaked away. God ! It worked !
5,Works ! Works good on the LG.Even used it on my gf and it said she was not on the same level.Works awsome get it !
5,Did exactly what I needed! Worked perfectly. Worth it.
5,Simple and effective This is the only leveling tool you need. Have been using this on every device I've had. Extremely stable and just does what it's meant to.
4,Can be tricky to calibrate but once done it works great. Small file size ... Can be tricky to calibrate but once done it works great. Small file size too puts it above any similar app
5,Great ap to have. You never know when you need a level.
5,Recommended Does exactly what you want it to. Simple spirit level
5,Excellent Got us out of trouble when without a "real" level. Worked a treat. Recommended. And free too!

5,Sick works great Best levelers app hands down
3,Samsung gs 3 App only works for a few uses and then data has to be cleared or it just freezes on GS3 dev please update
5,Pretty darn cool This is a pretty cool app, I like the simple features it has, such as the change of view when you tilt your phone. It's pretty spot on too. Good job who ever had it!
5,Bubble level Absoloutly brilliant 5 stars
5,HTC EVO LTE app works great
5,Antony One of those stupid apps that you may never use or need, but if you ever need it...
3,Ok for most things Rubbish at 45 degrees. It just keeps switching between potrait and landscape impossible to read.
5,Handy Handy easy to use.
5,Handy Tool Sure beats going to garage or driving to shop for tools!!! Needs an occasional calibration but usually its the phone! Then, viola...perfect!!!
4,Contractor A useful tool for my portable device.
5,Great Have installed 2 doors, an archway and countless shelves, racks and trim with this app. Works great.
5,Perfect Works simply perfect. Used it to level pix with my phone. Slick, easy, and free. What else can you ask for?
5,Great Works great. Just make sure you don't drop ur phone!

1,Good, battery killer Works awesome but new update doesnt allow phone to sleep and kills my battery in about 11 hours if its not being used. Had to delete it, handy when needed

5,Awesome!! Great app, free, works, in SD, and does not chug memory. Thx developer.
5,Nice, Galaxy SII Epic Touch I used this once recently to hang a fixture after having it installed for months. This qualifies as one of the more useful apps now. Love the way bubble level changes type when orientation changes.
4,HTC Incredible Works great for hanging things like pictures and the like. Handy app to have.
5,Good Does exactly as needed
5,Handy tool Fills the bill in a pinch

5,Perfect! Nice and easy. You get what you expect. Thx :-)
5,Does what I need it to do @ Keith, I'm not an expert but I would recommend to use a real level to calibrate it. Just saying, thats how I did. Lol
5,Nifty little thing Used it to level a crooked desk. Worked =D
5,Awesome app Great app works perfectly.

5,Does the job. I was just hanging pictures. If I was building a house I'd probably go to Home Depot.
5,It works I thought it was just a novelty but it actually works & is true on the level.

5,Level Ok
5,razr works
5,DROID x
5,Works I'm well happy with this. I especially like the way it beeps on level! If it helps anyone, I switched to 'orientation sensor' - Galaxy Ace, UK.
2,Could not calibrate properly Looks like it would be handy if it would calibrate correctly. When standing up it registered level when the phone was crooked and when I put it level, it registered all the way to either side. Using the sideways level worked better but still not true.
5,Good level tool This is the most addicting game ever
5,Haha
5,Bubble level cool tool especially for a tool freak like me!
4,Cool Not sure how accurate it is but it works - and no weird permissions.
5,Lifesaver if you need to reset your phone's compass or accelerometer this does it too. Perfect design.

5,Works perfect. Hung my 51" Plasma with this apparently. TV is perfectly level so apparently is the real deal. And all the people who can't get an accurate level....recalibrate on level surface before use.
2,This app doesn't work here. The Bubble Level app works just fine, but with ... This app doesn't work here. The Bubble Level app works just fine, but with this one the bubbles seem very nervous, popping from the left to the right.
5,Works well Use at work. Compared to torpedo level I use for conduit as well as machinist level. As good as torpedo, just a little off on machinist. I believe I can comp with calibration, but plenty good for hanging light fixtires.
5,AWESOME!!! YOU CAN ALWAYS TELL IF A GUY'S ON THE LEVEL IF HIS BUBBLE'S IN THE MIDDLE. :)
5,Love the options Tried a couple different Level apps and found this very helpful? Leveled my Fridge! Also, Calibrating will compensate for any protruding buttons on your phone. just gotta remember to use the same side of phone every time.
5,ok App I played around with it works fine for my needs. I would not use it for any thing mission critical work. for setting picture frames and or house hold tables or things like that it is a good tool to have on your phone
5,Good idea Very good virtual tool. Next app should make phone a chainsaw
1,Update ruined a great app All the other apps were 90 degrees off on my tablet... this was the best. That is until... until the update,.. worthless now.... have no working level app now thanks to the update..... what a disapointment. Funny... 1.9.0 & 1.9.1 says now support tablet.... 1.9.2 should say....now it does NOT support tablets!!!!!!!
5,Xperia Arc S Cool. Seems to work fine.
3,Sony Ericsson Live Very useful if didnt need calibrating
1,... This level is out of level,
4,Too bad Seems to be very accurate, but not with the Nexus S, the phone has no solid straight edge.
5,Bubble level Very cool! Appears the phone must be horizontal to work properly.
5,Very Nice Works well on my rooted book tablet.
5,Works! Love it. Precise. Works just like it is advertised and supposed to work. Practical for all your leveling needs. Its not a power hog, gimmick or crap app! Works seamless with no BS.
1,Axis reversed in this version. App is no longer usable due to axis beng swapped in this version. Please upload older version under alternate name.
5,Yay! I've been doing a lot of projects lately and this is so handy. I use it constantly and its accurate :) HTC Evo
5,Bubble level Works great used it several times.
5,Simple but effective. Does what it says.
5,Testig accelerometer I used this app to test the accelerometer on my phone (which I found does noy work), but I can definitly see this being used for it's intended purposes. Nice. Where is the source code for this?
5,Muy recomendable Una de las mejores aplicaciones pr?cticas referentes al uso de los sensores. Simple y eficiente. No reclama acceso sin condiciones a tu equipo. Se agradece mucho.
4,Handy Really handy when u need a level & don't have the tool with u.
5,Great app Great app still great after update on my Huawei Ascend 2
4,Nice and simple Only used it about twice in the last year, but when I've needed it it's been great to have. Seems to be accurate.
5,Very handy Nice interface and not bogged down with ads. kudos to developer.
5,I love this app its actualy correct. I use it all the time at work
3,New update has major flaw! Bubble goes in wrong direction after update. App is no use now! Was excellent before.

2,Ok before update Does not work well after update. Samsung ace.
5,Well-executed It's a simple idea, but real software development is not the cakewalk some people seem to think it is. This is a well-written app -- it's tiny, stable, and does one thing well. Bravo!
1,Poor No good
5,Level Thanks!
5,* Great & useful app.
1,Junk Junk

4,Bubble Works ok
5,LOL Dope!
2,Works incorrectly on tablets? Level orientation is always off by 90Åã on my Acer Iconia. Looks like this app doesn't work correctly on tablets.
4,Good app Works well in a pinch when no level is around. I use it to level picture frames and such. Worth the download.
5,Love this app I use this app frequently at my job. Never lets me down.
1,Does not work Would not read true level even after calibration on samsung galaxy s2
5,Works great! It works, it's free, it's ad-free. What more could you ask for?
5,Calibrate and good to go. It would probably be a good idea to calibrate it first. Your phone probably wasn't calibrated right at level / plum . So it's not the apps fault if is a bit off. Also watch for things like bumps from buttons, cameras, and curves in phone
1,Way off ...! I'm a journeyman carpenter with over 22yrs and downloaded this app to level a picture frame on my wall. It was off by almost 1/2"!!!! this is simply a novelty, NOT to be trusted to ACTUALLY plumb or level anything. MVM - Phx Az
5,FANTASTIC App! Very useful. I use it more than I thought. Extremely handy to have. Very accurate once calibrated.
5,Awesome. I was positive that the pinball machine tilted right, and this proved it. Useful, free, fast, without unnecessary app permissions. Thanks, and best of luck.with your other efforts!
3,Word Word
5,BLACKGUNGURU As long as u have a good spot to calibrate, this app iz hands down best level app in existence:)
5,Very good Not perfect but close enough for basic stuff.
5,Chris Great app. Works on Xoom, just need to go into settings and alter orientation.
3,Alright It seems to work ok.... it drains the battery a bit too quick. Atrix2
4,Great app! I have used this app more than I ever thought. When I need a level it's as close as my phone.
5,A first-rate software product. Why can't other Market apps be this perfect? Calibration feature is spot-on.
2,Poor calibration/accuracy Does not allow for true 180' calibration. (Rotate device 180 on " level" surface. If TRUELY level surface, level will remain at zero.)
0,Good however I did notice that is does not handle 45degree angles well
4,Really handy This is a no frills, no extras app. Does what it says, does it very well.
5,Derik VERY handy and accurate for field geol. Nice & simple to use and calibrate. Perhaps the addition of a compass on same circle w/round bubble level? A+!
5,Bubble level Use it to level my touring caravan so easy no more hunting for level I had used before downloading this app
5,Best for galaxy nexus Tried lots of level apps on galaxy nexus and some jitter and some don't rotate, this one is smooth accurate and it works with rotation perfectly. I like the clean looks here too...
3,Good idea But not every phone is totally flat. Buttons and camera stick out to create a uneven surface
5,Works great. Works very well, what else its there to say?
5,Nice Works good. And stop complaining and calibrate it.
5,The right tool for me & you. Quick. Easy. Simple. I use it all the time.
5,Great app Brilliant app 5 star all the way
5,Worth Money This app does it's job brilliantly, with an intuitive interface and decent graphics.
5,Great Very useful. Very simple
4,Quick check Great for doing a quick check. Sure it is not going to be very accurate but hanging a photo or seeing a general angle it works great.
1,Doesnt work on xoom Orientation off by 90degrees on xoom tablet
5,Excellent and accurate Great app to have. Very handy for getting things justright.
2,LG G2 hates this level Could be the phone, but I would calibrate on a known level surface & then move to a different surface and calibration would be off. Tried 5 or 6 times with no success. It also seemed to never get which way it should be oriented except when it was on its back.
5,Nerd toy Appears to have been a fun app to write. It is a level. Not much else to say.
5,Bubble app I use this app several times a week. At first I was laughed at but now I am asked to pull it out and use it.
4,Helpful Worked absolutely great in a pinch. Didn't have a level to hang a shelf. But Idk if I would trust it over a real level....
4,Handy Good to have, if only to keep the wife quiet about whether or not the stove is level.
5,Great little tool I can't tell you how many times I've used the handy tool .... it always impresses people too.
1,Doesn't work on Galaxy S II Doesn't work on Galaxy S II
5,Great app Do figure "eights" with your phone if it doesn't seem to be working and it will work perfectly - it's the phone that needs adjusting.
1,A malfunctioning app The tilt it shows is 90 degrees off. Tilt it to the left or right, and it will show a fore/aft tilt, and vice versa. How useless. ( This is on a samsung galaxy.)
5,level Very nice app. I downloaded it at work and used this the same night at home to hang curtains. Wife loves it!
4,A level view. A well thought out, easy to use app. It does what it's asked to do. The only downside is the site view is a little small, hence the 4 instead of 5.
5,Great I just used it to hang my televisions in my offices. This isa vere useful app highly recommend it .. Galaxy S ll
5,Galaxy SII Works flawlessly! Kudos to the developer!

5,Great Awesome...accurate....must have
5,Genius! I love this app. So simple, so useful. Great on HTC Inspire 4G.

1,Worked before, now useless Had this app on my original droid. Worked well. Fails miserably on droid x2. multiple calibrations, still won't level. Uninstalled.
1,Doesn't work correctly Moto XOOM, incorrect orientation. It is 90 deg off. Can't find a way to correct in prefs. Makes it of limited value.

5,Great Now even better.
5,Question... I have a DROID X2. The top end of the phone where the camera is located is almost twice the thickness of the other end of the phone, so when it is laid flat, the phone is not itself level. Does your app account for this?
3,Sideways On my Samsung galaxy excite, it's sideways. Not as useful as it was on my nexus1
2,DROID X Isn't accurate at all. I Even calibrated it and did not help.
1,about as good as my eyeball level. Galaxy s Vibrant
4,Seems to do exactly what it says it will. Works great. Droid Incredible.
3,Good for stuff occasionally. Good for hanging pictures, leveling tv, etc.
5,Neat! Handy gadget. :)
2,Constatly disappears on droid bionic I love the app, however, it disappears off of the bionic & I have to reinstall it over and over again.. this is the only app that does that.
1,Totally not level. I tried to use it for a picture and it was like a 45 degree angle when it said it was level.
5,Won't do bar level at all. Epic 4G andr 2.2 Won't chg from 360* version, so nothing to lock. Difficulty (for me) measuring inclination.

5,I like it Works great for leveling my travel trailer since it doesn't have to be perfect, just close enough. The audible tone is great since I can lay the phone on a counter top, crank the volume then go outside and mess with the jacks.

4,Nice app but assumes edges of phone are flat Only one edge of my Verizon Casio Commando is flat enough to use as a reference so frequently the numbers are sideways or upside down. The Commando also has a protruding area on one corner of back so it needs to hang over the edge of a surface to lay flat. Calibration needs better explanation.
