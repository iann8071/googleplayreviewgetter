5,Handy, works quietly all the time Great, just what you want in a widget. Area to improve: With my eyesight, I would love to be able to pick a brighter color for negative numbers, such as orange, as the red on black background can be hard for me to read.
5,I have 6 of these running Very good, useful. A major problem is that the stock codes of each widget is not backed up anywhere (although the "global" portfolio data is). When a widget becomes borked, lost by the home app or accidentally deleted, you have to create a new widget and enter each stock code again from scratch. That happens rarely, but often enough to be a major irritation. A good solution would be to import the stock codes from a backup... or be shown all the codes in the portfolio and check-mark the ones you want.
5,Very good Small and neat, and can display exchange rates too, exactly what i needed!
5,Great Stock App! I have one enhancement request... store the stock data I add to the widget in a way that allows it to be backed up and restored. I run multiple widgets on different screens and had to reenter all the ticker and portfolio information manually after my phone crashed. What a pain!
4,Best Stock widget I've found Had the features I was looking for that google finance and all the other stock apps i tried didn't have. Simple and easy to set up. A feature request for me would be a way to add a total below the stocks, so I could see how my portfolio as a whole is doing.
5,Light weighted widget Almost perfect. 5x4 size would be praktischer...
5,Excellent Simple, but does everything I need perfectly.
5,Best Stock widget Small and flexible features. Runs great on my Nexus5!
5,Best by far! Simple and elegant
4,Good Works pretty well
5,Love it!
5,Simple, powerful. I use it more than Google Finance, Yahoo, etc.
5,Works Without a hitch
4,Fix Indian stock updates Been using the program for 2 months without any problems. Having issues from last week as sensex and other Indian stocks are not getting updated.. Pls fix..
4,Good App....small problems... Settings menu is overly complicated. Randomly throughout the year, ^DJI will stop updating. So you can see your stocks, but not the overall market index DJI. Annoying. Otherwise, great size options, good refresh options, good overall app. Fix the DJI update issue, and its 5 stars.
1,Not working on Galaxy S2 Trying it in Pune, India. Can lookup & add stocks. But widget does not show prices..says no data. Am trying Sensex stocks (Bombay Stock Exchange). Apparently, it takes data from yahoo & yahoo has stopped providing data for Sensex/Indian exchanges
5,Fantastic Simple, clean and informative. Exactly what I was looking for. Blows my mind why Google Finance, Yahoo and Bloomberg can't produce such a brilliant widget for their apps, most of those are completely useless. Thanks again!
5,The more I use it the more I love it It makes my phone what it is suppose to be. Fast, simple, elegant and informant ask on one screen. Why cant a rss reader be so easy?
5,You could use nasdaq oficial webpage to get the live price. That would be ... You could use nasdaq oficial webpage to get the live price. That would be neat :) Best widget. Would be awesome if it wasn't delayed but still its good
5,faboulous app! looks great! works as advertised i would gladly pay a dollar for a professional version of this app which includes the following: more customizable fields. for instance i would like to view day change percent with total investment change on the same screen. an indicator that gives me a warm fuzzy while the app is attempting to update the ticker data. a customizable refresh where i can decide in minutes how often i would like to refresh and also a radio button that when checked will update continually as changes are made in the stock price.
