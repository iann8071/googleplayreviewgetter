5,Good But it must be better if databases are seperated into small size (1 data is lower than 1 GB) Whether English wikipedia is divided into 12 aar data (= 11 Gb)
1,Very poor work done The app is very, very poor in options and features. Cannot be compared to GoldenDict.
5,Excellent How can I add articles directly without compiling?

5,Totally freekin awesome!! Exactly what I was looking for. Wasted too much time looking for another offline wikipedia app. Glad I finally found this! THANK YOU!
2,Windows Converter tool 1. Where is it? 2. Add categories, for wikipedia. otherwise, old database... Edit: thanks, but don't think it's easy for us, to make a windows converter, also, why not add categories? Wiki taxi is good with this, it has the 2 options available.
4,Nice
5,Essential Using it for over a month, I found it perfect app . Faced no problems. I hope it is integrated in in searchable items of Google search app. Thanks for that great developer
5,Very useful I'm using this on my mobile as well as on PC to view offline dictionaries. It is very useful, fast and smooth worthy for 5 star. I will be delighted if it has NIGHT MODE option too.... to save power with amoled screens.
5,Extremely Useful Great for when you can't rely on a data connection for all your information needs. High quality free and open source software. Also use this on a Nokia N800, a linux laptop and have recommended it to friends and family. It's fast, light, clean and stable. Biggest drawback is that the full Wikipedia file is unavoidably huge but with flash memory getting cheaper all the time that shouldnÅft be much of a barrier. Highly recommended.
5,Any fact, anywhere This is a great application. In my Samsung Galaxy 2 7.0, it runs well with 6.5gb wikipedia, giving me instant access to the equal of a few hundred volume encyclapedia set. If as a child you liked reading encyclopedias from cover to cover, like most normal kids, you will love this. Perhaps the reflow could be tweaked a bit, as linked pages come in formatted wider than the screen. I want this--with pics.
5,Excellent Fantastic program! Instant search results and fast, accurate rendering. Wish you could choose or temporarily disable specific "books". Pinch zoom would be great (you can zoom from the settings button). For an up-to-date, full English Wikipedia, Google "aardc slow" and enter the GitHub discussion. A kind soul has been compiling/sharing WP as ~10 GB torrents. Pocket full of awesome even without Internet access!
5,Guys, that's all we need! very good, esp. as for technical articles: undistorted formulae unlike analogs
5,Best Offline-Wiki-App Full Wikipedia (eng) needs 10gb off sd-space. Searching in the whole dictionary works superfast. Also math-formulas get shown right with this app. Thanks for this great app!
5,Perfect for offline Wikipedia A recent (April 2012) compressed copy of the whole Wikipedia is available (takes just 10GB). The latest Aard version doesn't work on Android 1.6 devices like Archos 5IT/48, but the previous version 1.3.1 is just fine (the 1.3.1 apk can be downloaded from other sites).
5,Fantastic Fast, well formatted and a pleasure to use. I wish there was someway to browse the dictionaries without needing a search string.
5,Perfect. Open source. The only way to go.
1,Can't download dictionaries! Tries to download from app, starts download then says download unsuccessful! I tried directly from site online and it was still unsuccessful...
