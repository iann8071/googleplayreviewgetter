5,Time to wake up and drink coffee! Great app for waking up! Short or long naps are great. And the coffee reminder kept me happy!
5,Brilliant This app is very useful and effecient. Very well coded. Would be nice to have an option to set a nap alarm from the app itself along with an option to do it from widget
2,looks promising but Really doesnt' work.
3,Its a great Good i had it for a long time now but on 4.2.2 the widget is too big and takes up 4 spaces fix this please
5,Best Nap App It is the easiest and fastest to use nap app, as long as you know how widgets work.
5,Love it! I've been using it for a very long time and I still love it. Being narcoleptic means a lot of naps so the widgets are perfect.
5,Love it Love widget but this version it take too much space.
4,I was gonna create my own napping app... ..but then I found this one. The simplest and quickest way to insta-nap and have phone go to silent mode and come out at the end of your nap. Brilliant. Only one I found that actually does this right!
5,Ringtone Changer Would Be Great Individual widget ringtone customizer would make this pay-worthy.
3,Works, but must create a widget for each nap length
5,Best Verrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrry best for me.
5,Perfect Exactly what I needed
5,Wah wah. Very good app. Power naps here I come.
2,Doesn't keep ringing if phone is facedown when alarm goes off.
5,Love it! Works brilliant on X10i and Vega
1,not working Keeps showing instructions rather than alarm
