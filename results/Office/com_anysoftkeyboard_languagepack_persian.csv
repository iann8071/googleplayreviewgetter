4,Nice app But the only thing I would change is to switch the locations of the Persian (?,?,?) and "standard" (1,2,3) numbers. Please consider, since in Farsi usually only Persian numbers are used.
5,Excellent app for typing Persian. I'm very pleased with this app.

5,Don't blame the app if you are too stupid for it! This keyboard works fine if you can follow directions. You need two things - first you need Arabic fonts so the letters are not disconnected, second you need to install AnySoftKeyboard first since this is just an add-on to that application. Pedram you have done a nice job on this, but is it just me or is the letter gaf (?) missing?
