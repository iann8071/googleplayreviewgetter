4,Nice app But the only thing I would change is to switch the locations of the Persian (?,?,?) and "standard" (1,2,3) numbers. Please consider, since in Farsi usually only Persian numbers are used.
5,Excellent app for typing Persian. I'm very pleased with this app.

Pedram you have done a nice job on this, but is it just me or is the letter gaf (?) missing?
