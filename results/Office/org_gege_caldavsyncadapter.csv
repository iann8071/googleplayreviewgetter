5,AKB I don't know why its rating is so low. Only free Caldav app on play store,completely working. Don't know what else anyone want.
3,Android Device Does Not Dynamically Sync with iCloud 11/26/2013 - I tried many configurations and couldn't get any of them to work. I did a little research on how to configure this and it works perfectly. Now I can update the calendar from any device, IOS or Android, and all other devices that connect to iCloud are in sync. 12/3/2013 - Not sure what has happened but I went to set an appointment today on my iPhone and it will not get through to my Samsung Note tablet. I do see the event in the iCloud calendar and it goes to the other IOS devices just fine. The only resolve is to delete the Caldav account and recreate it. Once I do that it will sync everything in the iCloud calendar to the tablet but the same problem occurs if I try to create a new event in my iPhone. I am running v 1.8.1. I will check if another release is available but I have to downgrade this rating to 3 stars until some progress is made.
4,Great calendar sync Works very well maybe too well... Can we have a way of turning down the sync... Every minute it synchronized .. Little bit excessive? Nothing has changed .. Maybe have a option to change the frequency? But apart from that loving it and well bloody done mate ;)
4,Sync frequency is to adjustable. Good app in general. However, for a mobile phone it is very important to be able to set how often a calendar has to be updated as it saves the battery and mobile traffic.
4,Working with davical with no issues. Usefull tool.
3,A couple of bugs Works great but there are still a few bugs. For example, if it cannot connect it kills the battery.
1,Wrong app. It says caldav, but loads carddav instead.
3,Bit bugging but works So it seems to throw a lot of error messages as notifications which also seem to conflict with dashclock but overall it seems be working.
4,Does the job ..JB.4.3 Good job. Will8ng to pay 4 an all included owncloud app. Thanks. Keep up the good work.
5,Dors the job Thanks a lot Gege for your work. I truly appreciate the 2 ways sync feature. Keep up the good job. Thank you for tour hard work
1,Not working It installs but I can't launch app.
5,Amazing
1,Does not work well at all... Not sure how anyone got this to work reliably. I installed it got it to work for about 3 days, then it starts showing the wrong times of meetings due to TimeZone difference. Also started showing multiple meeting with the same name and times. All the other clients that I have used have a "show in local Time Zone" setting. Not sure what happened here, but if you setup a meeting in PST, and there is a person on the East Cast EST/EDT, You should have the option to display the meeting in your Local TimeZone. In this case a 3 hour difference. No go, Uninstalled.
1,Doesn't display most events My work calendar has some 20 events per week, this only displays one event. Unusable
4,Ok It works nice for free but after restarting of my phone I allways lose all caldav account and must set it up again... that is annoying!!!
4,I had no problems with two-way links between it and my beehive-based email server. sometimes it would warn that it wouldn't work, but it worked anyways.
1,Avoid Installed after reading an Android.appstorm article touting it. Then couldn't get response to determine URL which is vital to setup. After several days waiting for response from Developer and searching his Web site, I'm throwing in towel. Droid Raxr HD Maxx v4.1
4,Worked fine so far and meant I didn't need to download Touchdown bloat ware.
5,Impressive is the word This is one of the real useful app that does good to android users. Am real happy with the ease of install configure and successful one way sync. Looking fwd to the two way sync soonest to make my calendaring complete wo 3rd party app. Hope the 2 way sync dont disappoint with bugs to shake our confidence.
4,Missing timezone support Fantastic app as long as you don't get sent calendar invites from folks in different time zones.
