3,Fun, but (still) no export on my device I like it a lot, but the PNG export feature does not show up on my Samsung Galaxy Tab 2. Also I can't copy to clipboard because there is no button or menu to do so. Would appreciate it being fixed :-)

3,ƒc Cool. It came up random letters on my text but when i texted it to my buddy she said she saw it right. Also, downloads Japanese cartoons on your phone... :/ other than that, good ^-^
1,Stupid Maybe you should rethink making apps. You can't export or copy and paste. This doesn't even deserve one star.
1,Ok Doesn't work so well. Lines aren't meeting up right.
5,Lim Good
