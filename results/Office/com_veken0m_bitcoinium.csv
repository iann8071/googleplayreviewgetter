5,Programmer is very responsive, great feature list. I use widgets to provide at a glance bitcoin stock levels (e.g. BTC-e), and, for mining status for my miners on various pools.. Definitely worth the donation, I use it daily (several times daily, in fact! ). Some screen formatting concerns for Nova Launcher, but great with default launcher (Nova was my choice, not this guys fault). Optional tap on a widget to get on demand updates. New pools and updates to pool API's regularly. This app is well supported.
3,Good app Good app but I'd like to see the option of larger widgets.
3,Widgets no longer exist I bought the paid for version as kudo to developers, uninstalled free version, now the widgets are gone and can not be found in available widgets. Odd. Help?
5,Doesn't load charts on 4G Internet works fine, this doesn't. Waste of money.
5,Best app out there This is an excellent tool for monitoring btc and your miners. Great widgets
5,Well done, developer. Certainly worth the money I've spent for the 'pro' version, now if only Google would take bitcoin as a payment method....
5,Best out there Happy to purchase now that BTC Guild support was added. I've tried all the bitcoin widgets available and this is the best.
5,Best out there Best bitcoin app out there. Upgraded from free version because Dev deserves the recognition.
5,Great app, does what it's supposed to... Would love to see support for miner stats for some ltc pools
5,Great for keeping an eye on coins Love this application, have it open almost all the time. Can you please enhance alarm feature to include LTC (BTC-e) ? I'm having to use a separate app just for that. Also LTC API is on MtGox, just not trading yet so will be nice to set an alarm for 0.00001 to see when trading starts.
5,Good but sometimes wont work api issue not developer's fault Read title
5,You got my vote So many crap app for bitcoin, this one rocks !
5,Nice app Love the ticker. Worth the price. Add trading if you can.
5,Sooooo sooooo good I love having four different exchanges on my desktop! The graph is good too, for when I'm away and wondering about price movements. I sent you a tip as well :)
4,Great app Great app but would be better if there were different widget sizes available. Come on, so small.
5,Awesome app Michael rocks
5,Fantastic app No problems at all with this app. Only thing it's missing are high/low & buy/sell graphs on the Price Graph.
5,love your work! upgrading to support your great team. almost a one-stop app for all your mobile cryptocoin needs. can't wait to see what gets included next.
