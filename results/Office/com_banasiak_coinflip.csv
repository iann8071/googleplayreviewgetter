5,Didn't need a coin flip to keep this app Simple, ad-free, some options, no permissions need... Much appreciated, Richard.
5,Best Coin Flip Out There No permissions make this the best flip app.
5,No permissions All the "other" coin flips require access to call history, or running apps, or network access. This so does exactly what it says.
5,It Delivers. This app works. I already bought the mega pack. It's oddly fun to mess with. And nearly everything goes to the SD card so it hardly impacts phone storage. (no permissions is a nice bonus.)
1,Coin toss always shows heads for first time
5,Does what it says No ad, no permission requests, as advertised on the app page
3,You cannot change the the State from which quarter represents.
