4,Fast and handy This is great app. I have been searching for some application to fetch GAL contacts as the in built app in Android 2.1 is not fetching all the details of contact. But this is one stop solution to that problem. Very fast and handy. Definitely a must download.....
5,Excellent addition Works well as an additional resource to the default contacts app. One thing though, is it possible to do a phone number lookup? As in search for person if you got only their number.
4,Best App Of all the various apps I've seen in the market, this one is simplest, safest and useful one. DOES NOT REQUEST UNWANTED PERMISSIONS, is light weight and very well done. Thanks Vivek... Hope to see more of such utility apps from you... Update: Got a new phone (Huawei Ascend G700) few days ago, if I click on retrieved results, the app crashes. Please Fix this.
5,Does exactly what I wanted it to do. App did exactly what I wanted it to. I've recommended it to my IT department to assist those who want to BYOD. Thanks.
5,SUPERB Perfect application..This one thing was missing from my phone.This app has made my Android phone complete.Feeling proud that an Indian has made such a great application.Keep it up Mr Iyer...
4,Good one but please show all the fields. Very useful app. But please show all the fields (Exchange 2007). The usage varies. For example, in my organization, many times I look at the address field since we have multiple offices in same city. Couple of other fields I look at is Manager, Fax, Seat Number etc., SHOW ALL FIELDS
4,Fills a hole. Should be included in android, but this app does an adequate job. It's a bit simple in looks and features though...
5,Works well I used to have all sorts of issues but it seems since a recent update this app works exactly as expected
4,Great application, missing one feature The application works great, but I'm missing one (huge) feature that I couldn't find in any other application. If you could make the application visible as "Account" at android system and this way I could view the Corporate Contacts on my OS application "Contacts" it would be great. Every x time to sync the contacts to the device, and visible to contacts. Other that that, great application.
5,Fantastic app! Why the heck android doesn't do this by default is beyond me... Thank you Sir for extending the functionality of android... You might want to talk to Google and add this functionality to next android version...
5,Samsung Galaxy S2 An excellent application to have with for quick search of corporate addressbook credentials.
5,Excellent Does the job very well. Simple interface and great functionality. Was looking for something exactly like this. You'll rarely find people who have the heart to develop something like this for free :-) thanks dev
2,Won't do anything Not sure if it's a jb issue or what, running cm10 and after I put my info in it says it's connecting and does nothing, connecting to exchange 2010.
3,No wildcard search Not useful if one doesn't know the exact spelling. Sync functionality soul of also be nice for offline access/getting changes
5,spot on! just the feature I was looking for. comes builtin with windows 8 phone and iphone, so I'm pleased to be able to do it on my android. thanks for the generosity!
5,Thanks fornhelpin the whole world! I wish M$ will think more about the users on all platforms and less about the old classic caee of everyone-on-PC
5,Great App Fantastic app. Love the completeness in data. Thanks. If possible, please add the ability to take contacts offline in a separate phone book such that when i delete the app the contacts get deleted too. Don't want to carry that data in my phonebook once I am gone from here .
5,Excellent App! Simply superb. Worth downloading and spending time.
5,Works very well Thanks. I really wanted this functionality. Finally found an app that does it perfectly.
5,excellent lean app Just what I missed as a corporate user on exchange.
4,GALにアクセスできて 検索も細かくできるのでちょうほうしてます。
