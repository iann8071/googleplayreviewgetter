5,Default currency not working Good that finally we get something on Android. Fully appreciate the fact it is quite early for the app. One thing I noticed is that changing of currency does not work - dollar remains there despite of the setting. Another annoyance is that by default when entering the amounts it enters values beyond decimal point rather than full amounts. Thanks. Edit: 2012-12-05 OK, got currency to work OK - it might have come with one of latest updates - thanks. Still annoyed with having to enter extra zeroes each time at each amount entered. Anyone else has that? BTW, export works beautifully and with the feature to enter default email address it is seamless. The import into GnuCash needs few clicks to create matching transactions depending from which assets they are funded from. Keep up the good work! Adding one star more to the review. Edit 2013-12021. QIF export and then import to Desktop Gnucash works Great
2,Photos and spare-time I use it at home. I think that the most significant thing for phone version is a "notes" about purchase. For example: I buy goods, minimum what I need -- is to make photo of goods and invoice. Optionally, if I have spare-time, I can write price and name. Also I want to synchronize this and PC's version and edit transaction. Photo for transaction can be a killer-feature.
2,Nice idea Not usable with complex account structure. Transfer-accounts not in alphabetical order. Account import file filter excludes the actual .gnucash-file, need to rename to .log. Needs favorite accounts. Needs balancing/starting amount for cash accounts.
5,Very useful App Its a nice companion to Gnucash, using it for a week now with no issues. if you can, please add the option to import transactions too , not only accounts .
5,So far so ok Few more features to bring it up to par with desktop version. Keep it up guys!
3,Nice Integration with desktop version is a hassle though: one needs to export transactions and then import them manually in gnucash
5,Simple and useful It is very simple to use and I liked it. It would be nice if syncing was introduced, and the final financial statement after adding all the credits and debits. But still I love it.
5,Pulita e completa La migliore che ho trovato che sia open e funzionale per tenere la contabilit?. Supporta l'utile "partita doppia".
2,Great idea but useless for most transactions since I can't enter splits. Is that ... Great idea but useless for most transactions since I can't enter splits. Is that a planned feature? Great idea but useless for most transactions since I can't enter splits. Is that a planned feature?
4,Great app I am using this software for personal use, both desktop and Android versions I have. Can we have scheduled transaction facility in mobile app?
5,Very handy companion to desktop app Well developed app. Very handy for keeping track of expenses on the go. The developers are very responsive to the users' feedback.
1,Needs updates Can't import
5,Excellent app
3,Bug in importing OFX into Desktop version I'm using double-entry accounting and when I import the OFX file (extracted from the mobile app) into the desktop app, the accounts rarely match and end up in the Orphan account.
3,Switched to Financius for now
1,It's broken Every time I add an expense/spend on my credit card it shows as credit in the credit card account when I debit my bank to pay the credit card it again credits the credit card account and my expense doubles Never had this on the linux desktop version Please fix it
1,Confusing After latest update all your accounts are put in a "root account" it makes the names to long and not easy to find because of the abbreviations and dots. My cash account is short cut to a "C". If you have a lot of sub accounts, than it becomes unworkable. Please fix this. I don't need all my accounts put in one root account. Today I also tried to import the ofx file into my desktop gnucash . It didn't work because didn't recognized my bank account . This app has therfore become useless. I've uninstalled it.
3,Some issues Much better but no split transactions and can't transfer between different currencies. Needs exchange rate support.
1,Doesn't work. Could not get the app to import from my desktop. Why doesn't the instructions for importing work? I wrote this review 3 months ago and it appears that nothing has changed in the program. I did just get a response from the people who made the app but that doesn't help.
5,Best accounting Program ever Also good as Windows version, too
