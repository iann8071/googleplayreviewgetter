5,Best than the 3 previous apps I had bought If only I'd knew this app existed earlier, I would've bought if sold. Only minor thing about this app that bothers me is the icons, they seem to me like prehistoric symbols, other than that, it's just awesome how easy it is.
5,All other money apps are Crap This is the only money app I've used where I can actually understand how to use it within the first five minutes and be able to add different types of incomes. Plus manage my money in many categories and be able to keep track of my money on hand. Best of all it's free Whoo
5,The Best and the Easiest for Small Businesses I tested around a 100 apps before finalising this one. If you wish to have a home income expense chart or if you want a easy entry app for small businesses or professionals this is your right choice. However the app lacks online backup which is essential as per me in today's world. I Hope the dev takes care also custom ranged reporting could be added as FY is different in different countries or at least a start FY month just like start week day.
3,Installing again to try once more No doubt it seems like the app is full of all sorts of needed details to keep track n manage finances. But I have to be leery wen 3 straight days has recent posts all saying "simple to use". Again, probably filled with details but one thing the app does not appear to be "immediately after installing" is "easy/simple to use.. gotta question that feedback but I'll try to enjoy one more time
5,The best personal financial app Fully personize and detail account management makes this the best personal financial app. After checked some others top apps. This is my choice. However the graphic and interface not really well design, but this the most functional.
5,Great!! I've been using this app for 6 months and feeling great about it. It's very easy to use and very flexible. Highly recommend !!
5,Simple, Effective Tracking I love that I can keep multiple separate books, view budgets and cumulative amounts at a glance, password protect records, and export to csv. Beautiful.
4,Good double entry accounting app This app is very good, I wish it will have the function to integrate with cloud service like Dropbox so we can easily to transfer the backup from one device to another device.
4,Great app Hire a designer to update the graphics and get a widget! Cover those two areas and you've got a golden app
5,One of my favorite apps of all time! Easy to customize expense categories, killer report tool especially pie chart & graph really helpful for my monthly expense tracking. Loved the balance sheet feature!
5,Best App Ever I have literally tried every money tracking app in the book and this is the only one I'll use. Easy and efficient. Allows me to do every thing I want. Doesn't force you the do anything like add bank account information. Only thing is I hate the look/appearance but its the only app that will let me do what I want in a simple mannor
5,Best app for money Thanks guys! I can't live without it!
5,Good apps This is very good apps. Very helpful . One thing instead of csv can it be export to. xsl
5,Great App and easy to use Just had to go through the how to use tutorial and got the hang of it quickly. I can track all my expenses quickly and easily. I also like how I can export my accounts for use on a computer.
4,Great but.. The application is very good. But a search option is not there and the charts could be better. I tried to contact the developer. There is no response. Still on design and functionality aspects this of the best.
5,Just what I was looking for! Easy to use, and can hold multiple accounts
5,Excellent I use it to efficiently manage my accounts. The best among all the applications I have tried. Similar experience like gnucash on PC. One improvement could be to add support for transfer of money from expense accounts to other accounts. This is useful when we get a refund for some expense like flight cancellation.
5,Excellent and Handy The best out of best... I love it.....
5,Excellent app If you like details (like me) you will love this app (like me). Take your time to understand it.
5,Heaven Now i can stop wasting bandwidth using Google drive to track the money.
5,?容詳細 目前用過最好用的，不過希望能不同帳本互相作連結。像我台幣結購美金時，可以直接至美金帳本增加金額。目前只能改帳本key
