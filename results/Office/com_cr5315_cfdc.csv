4,Ottima Funziona bene, fa ci? per cui ? stata progettata. Segnalo bug all'arrivo dell'evento, invece di dare lo 0 rimane bloccata e il countdown dice che mancano alcune ore, anche se ormai dovrebbe stare a 0.
4,One suggestion It's great but would be even better if we it could use an entry from Google Calendar
3,Buggy Nice one, but.. One day off..
5,It does the job
3,Time is out. Love the countdown but it is off by about an hour. I get married in two weeks. The countdown on my home screen tells me it is 14 days 14 hours and 54 minutes which if you work it out manually is correct. Your countdown gives me 14 days 15 hours and 5 minutes.
5,Awesome, but here's an idea.. It's an awesome extension to Dashclock, thanks! Now, I know this is a countdown extension, but would it also be possible to implement a way to count upwards starting from a set date/time? Perhaps it could also be a separate extension that works similarly to this one. This would allow someone to keep track of, for example, how much time has passed since some kind of event (laundry, meeting, whatever), how many days they're alive or how many days they've been in a relationship with someone.
5,Exactly what I was looking for Very useful and the customizability is great! Thanks devs!
4,Update: Recommended fix worked =) Update: un-install/re-install of DashClock fixed the issue :-) Old: No longer appears after re-installation because it was no longer updating When I first installed days ago all seemed well. I noticed days-from event was not updating. Uninstalled and reinstalled hoping to fix issue. Now no longer showing up at all.
3,Nice idea Great idea... Would be perfext if it would link into the calendar
1,doesn't show up The countdown doesn't appear on my dashclock ;/
4,Great clean looking app runs solidly with no issues on my nexus Keep up the great work
5,5/5 I'm surprised this is available as a free widget. God bless
4,Minor Suggestion Can u add a function that counts the time since an event?
1,Wrong time Countdown time off by like 5 hours
1,Countdown time incorrect.
4,Spot on Would be even better if you could track multiple events... HINT HINT!
4,Looks good but doesn't work The countdown doesn't show up on my lock screen but otherwise making it works great
5,Excellent Very excellent.
