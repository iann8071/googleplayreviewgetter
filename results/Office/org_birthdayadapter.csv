5,Perfect Perfection incarnate. :-)
5,Nothing to fear I wanted to have the functionality of this app but was worried that my phone would be assailed with a photo of Richard M Stallman. Thankfully, users can rest assured that this version of Birthday Adapter does indeed give you a calendar comprised of your contact's Birthdays/Anniversaries without having to keep RMS's contact info and likeness on your phone. Good work, Dominik. Keep it up!
5,Easy and awesome Awesome app! Does exactly what it says and exactly what I needed. Displays your existing contact's birthdays in your existing Android calendar. No 3rd party calendars or contact apps just to see birthdays. Just one simple little app that you only need to run once to set it up, then just let it do it's thing.
5,Simple an useful It does exactly what I was looking for and it does exactly what it says.
5,Calendar integration Great.
5,Exactly what I wanted !!! I was so happy to find this app some weeks ago, which would do what I want. Just use the birthdays in contacts and display in calendar. Nothing else. I was even more happy after finding the app to be ready for Android 2.3. Just little idea : make the customized option to name birthdays or anniversaries.
5,Excellent work Something as basic as this is very handy. I will never forget important dates ever again, unless I lose my phone!
5,Great work Great app, must be default for stock android.
5,Does what it says on the tin
