4,Amazing but high RAM As others have said this is a must coming from iOS for those used to having all their notifications automatically display on the lock screen. This is even better than iOS because you can choose what notifications you want and leave out the ones you do not want. My only complaint about this app keeping it from 5 star is the amount of RAM being about 65mb. That is almost double of the main app this is extended from. Please try to get the RAM under 50mb for 5 star review.
5,Love it, but This is an awesome widget and, as has been mentioned, pretty much a must coming from iOS. Minor gripe/question below. My only issue is that I can't seem to get the appearance to work as desired on my phone running on KitKat. I've set the notifiers to show full detail, but they only do so when I've swiped back and forth and am in the view that allows me to access settings. Otherwise, it just displays the icons without content info. Is it possible to get this extended list view to be the default?
4,Vital Comming from iOS Comming from a iphone to a android phone, having notifications on my lockscreen is vital to me. This app allows you to easily see any notifications that you want from certain apps on your lockscreen. However one annoying feature of this app is that it displays the contents of the first message fine, but the rest it says e.g. "2 new messages' '3 new messages' I dont understand why it cant show the contents of the rest of the messages..ive even played around with the settings but nothing works. Apart from that, this app is a must have. In the future i would like to be able to dismiss all/certain notifications and also being to reply/delete etc from the lockscreen.
5,Awesome!!!! Love the app! Although I would love to have the ability to rename the dashnotifer extensions, that way it will make it easier to identify what app I have set of what dashnotifier #.
5,Excellent app with excellent support! Was having an issue with previous version. Notified the dev regarding the issue and the dev responded promptly. Issues were fixed and the app are very helpful
2,Good Idea, Bad Execution Hangout notifications don't work at all on my Galaxy S III and Gmail notifications don't turn on the screen even though I have the option enabled. Fix this and I'll modify my review.
3,Good, with one issue This extension works beautifully, except in one case. Multiple notifications (non-stacked) from one application seem to break its counter. Case in point, I have two Gmail accounts set up on my phone. When either one gets an email while the other account doesn't, everything works fine. If both accounts get an email and show a notification, however, then the widget starts acting oddly. Anyone know of a fix for this? Loving this otherwise, and I really want to rate it a 5.
4,One small request Would it be possible to add a "notification" without the number to the right. I would like to use my contacts for example. Or phone or a music app. The number is distracting. I just need a shortcut. Otherwise great app. Really dig it.
5,awesome It just hits my spot. it makes my android phone able to list almost all kinds of IM messages on the lockscreen, just like IOS. What's more, the feature of "wake up" make me excited. such a great app to complete my phone. i love it, love android.
5,Great and does the job The app does what I expect from it perfectly, and after setting it up, I never had to go back and mess with it. It's just smooth.
4,Almost perfect It's very useful and works well but I think that could be awesome if we're able rename what is showed in dashclock's config screen. Would be helpful to identify and reorder. Example: Rename Dashnotifier 10 to Hangout.
4,It's a great app, but.. Why we can add just 7 more apps?
4,Good app It does what it's supposed to. I use it to notify me with my corporate emails.
5,Now compatible with everything I throw at it. Had some problems with certain apps in the past but now works with everything I try.
2,Icons I like this extension...but the icons don't match the actual notification. It is set to use the notification's icon but for some it doesn't....like Google+. Instead of the g+ icon it shows the icon for Google+ Photos.
5,Works great Prefect for those apps that don't have specific Dashclock extensions.
5,A must have! Awesome extension to get notification On DashClock from any app!
2,Not working right with BBM It keeps telling me the 'connected' notification instead of the real content of the notification. Please fix this. Thanks.
5,5 Stars I thought I let my previous comment on Dashclock, not DashNotifier. This app is stupendous.
4,Almost perfect Coming from iPhone to Android I would like to have each separate including ones within the same category such as email etc. show an individual alert on the screen rather than stacking them. This would allow me to see if any of the new email or texts are important rather than having to unlock and check.
