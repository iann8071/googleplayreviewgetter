5,Sutta listing I am unable to find the list of suttas to choose from within each section. Eg. As soon as I click silakkhanda vagga, it goes to brahmajala sutta..
5,so awesome thanks so much Sir Yuttadhammo!! Amazing wealth of material.
5,Pralhad Mistri, Nasik, India In recent updates, problem of non-appearance of letters in dictionary search box is solved. In Older version there were section numbers which was good to identify sections. Overall this update is satisfactory .
5,The most valuable app Nice to see the latest version reaching for perfection.
5,Great work
5,Great Work!
4,Excellent! Thank you, Venerable, for providing this most wonderful resource! It is so useful to have Buddha's teachings at one's fingertips. One option I would like to see added is black text on white background - white text on black background can be very hard on the eyes for some :-)
5,Great App This is an amazingly comprehensive app! Be sure to go on WiFi before you download the database, anyone that downloads it. Can you include the ability to download other sutras (like the Lotus Sutra) in the next update?
3,No English... The start up page and setting/help options are in English, but otherwise no translation. I appreciate the Pali, but for this to be really useful it needs English. Please provide English translation. I studied Sanskrit and even that is pretty uncommon, so I'm not sure how many Android users know Pali well enough to appreciate or even use this app.
5,May you be happy Greatest application for an android device.
5,Very Nice
