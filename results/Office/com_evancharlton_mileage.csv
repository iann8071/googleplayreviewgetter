3,Decent mileage app I like that the app automatically colors entries based off of averages on mileage. Interface could use a little work. Was mildly annoyed by the fact that partial fill ups don't get calculated correctly for gas mileage. Still looking for a better app.
4,Very good app. One minor annoyance. When entering the data there is no '.' Period. Dot. Decimal. Or a way to access it on the keboard input. Samsung Galaxy S II Android 4.1.2 Samsung keyboard (Kies update caused problems on i777 with Google keyboard if that may contribute to the issue). In order to enter full odometer reading with tenth of miles, I have to go back in and edit it. Problem with somethingon my end?
4,Good app, suggestions for import improvements Pretty good. Import crashes if there are missing fields App is set to enter volume and total price, import with volume and price but no price per unit, will end up showing $1.00 in price per unit. Editing and saving without change updates to the correct values. With only one car you still have to have an ID column it could skip this and allow choosing a single car. It could recognise names of columns in CSV import rather than requiring you to enter them all even if the names match.
2,Pretty good but be warned Awesome, and I love it, but be careful MPG is calculated in US mpg, not UK mpg. Very misleading and you think your car isn't returning enough mpg. Please allow us to choose which gallon to use :)
5,Perfect for what I need Works perfectly on HTC Incredible & Razr Maxx. I had a little trouble with import, so with next phone I simply sent myself the backup file automatically created on old phone & dropped it into folder on new phone. Viola, all mileage data is there & no crashes.
2,Does not like partial fillups Everything seems OK until I enter a partial fill-up. Somehow my best is 7.04L/100 km, worst is 8.93L/100 km and average is 6.92L/100 km. How can the average be better than the best? The only way to get the numbers to work properly is to manually combine partial fill-ups to a true fill-up. Most of my other errors were my fault. It is easy to miss inputting a decimal point. That really messes up the calculations. Nice GUI though. So far all the apps like these don't allow the units to change on the fly. They are locked to the vehicle. That forces drivers who travel back and forth between the US and Canada to make some calculations before entering the data.
4,Great app...a few tweaks would make it better Great app and does what I need (for the most part). The stats are very good too. A couple of enhancements would make it even better. Give me the ability to enter the trip distance between fill-ups instead of relying solely on the odometer. Also, if I miss entering a fill-up and don't have the receipt, I would like to be able to create a new starting point w/o having to completely start over because I may not know what the odometer reading was or gallons used. The trip option and creating a new starting point would be helpful especially when I may not be the one that fills up the vehicle.
3,I love this app. I've use it for years since before flair was released as an os. But there is some glitch recently that the first fill up has the craziest p Mpg. Mine says I got over 23000 mpg for that tank, causing all my others to turn red. Also, it's been rearranging dates on it's own and putting in weird thingd that have no odometer readings. Not sure what's going on there.
5,Excellent, but needs the base graphs! Works great for me, but I would really like to see graphs from the base data: We need a simple mileage vs fill-up/date graph, in addition to the existing averages and such. This goes for the other data sets as well. Otherwise, I love the app!
5,Great app, have used w/o any problems for 2 yrs This is a great app. I have used it continuously for two years. Would gladly and easily pay for it if it were not for free. Question for the developer or other users - I recently upgraded from an Evo to the Galaxy Note II and can't figure out how to port over the data. I have exported the info from my old phone and even transferred it to Dropbox as a way of getting it to the Note II but can't figure out how to import it on the other side. Any advice is greatly appreciated.
5,Simple and useful! Does what it says well and does it simply. Easy to use. I love knowing my mileage every week and watching trends.
1,Used to work I have a Google nexus and this stopped working correctly awhile. Its unfortunate because this app used to be awesome.
4,Dates are wrong For some reason all the dates in this app are off by several days. Anybody know of a way to fix it? Other than that a pretty good app. Thanks
4,Really nice I tried out a few and settled on this one. Been using it for a few months and am very happy with it. All the features and info I wanted plus more. I have no complaints and recommend it. Peter
4,Great app Its a really great. The one problem I for me is with the second vehicle. It lets me add the second vehicle and input fill ups but it crashes when I try to access the history for the second vehicle... so I cant see any stats oe history for the second vehicle! Other than that its awesome.
5,Great App! Have been using it for almost a year, and it is an awesome way to track and maintain cost, mileage, and fuel efficiency data. The fill-ups ARE editable individually, contrary to some other reviews. Plus, you can export to a csv and view or edit in Excel. I have also checked the calculations (miles driven/gallons consumed) and they have always been spot-on. Only issue I have found is that when exporting to csv, the dates are sometimes intermittently hashed out (####). Configuring and setting up the service intervals is also a great feature-- I don't need it, but Wifey sure does! All in all, a great app, VERY useful, very functional, and FREE!
5,Almost perfect Very nice useful app. Doea exactly what I need w out any frilly distractions. Good clean functional app.
4,Milage App Math works correctly. Maybe it's another excel challenged user, that never got training (like 98% of the excel users out there). Microsoft doesn't care if you know how to use it, just as long as it's installed on another PC.
4,Great App but need to commit I once missed entering a fillup and it messed up all my stats. Not very forgiving in this way. But if you stick with it, it works very well. I entered a custom field to record the Octane to see if I could notice if sticking with the recommended Octane rating for my vehicle would improve mpg or not. It would be great if the developer could incorporate this into the app. I haven't analyzed the data yet to see if there is much of a difference. Likely too many variables at play anyhow. But love the app!
4,Nice App Great app, I love it. It does have the one flaw that if you miss a fill up, or do a partial, it chokes on the data. IOW, the partial fill option does not work like it should. Best course of action here is to see what your average has been and divide the miles since the last fill up and enter that in for gallons.
5,満タンでなくても満タン時にはちゃんと計算してくれるので使えます
