4,Export and import To many other diaries save it in there format. I changed phones and lost everything because the apply wouldn't see all the audio and video ones I did.
5,Works great with DayJournal I use this app because it's simple, easy, and it saves entries just like my journal on my computer, DayJournal, does.
3,Idk As soon as i clicked on the app it went straght to the entry with no password so i just give it an average
3,simple Easy to use. Supports landscape. UI is a little too minimalistic for my tastes.
4,Nice libra adfree app Looks like a nice diary but wish that it provided some formatting like font color, background color, font size. The word search is definitely needed.
5,Great This is an amazing app!
