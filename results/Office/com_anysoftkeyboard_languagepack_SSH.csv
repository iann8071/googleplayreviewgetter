5,Perfect :-) Just what I needed or I could not access arrow up for command history. Using ConnectBot with Samsung Galaxy Ace to access SSH on Ubuntu machine. Thanks 4 job well done
5,Nice app Probably lacks '.', ':' and numeric buttons (may be on a long tap?)
4,Anysoft != any soft I was puzzled for a while, thinking this would work with any soft-keyboard. It actually needs the keyboard program by "Anysoft" !
