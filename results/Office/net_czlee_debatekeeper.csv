4,Great App. Perfect for World Schools. Could it be adjusted to have an option of 7 min Speeches please. In South Africa we have Junior Debate Tournaments for speakers from 7th - 9th Grade who speak for 7 mins.
4,Its good but I seem to be having a problem since the POI button is always inactive I hope its just a bug or something since I have already changed the settings for the POI and it still is jnactive please address this issue
5,Great app It's absolutely a big help for debaters. It has all kind of debate styles and reminder of the time .
5,Works perfectly for BP!
4,Excellent Good aplication for debaters and adjudicators. Thanks.
5,Best!!!!! Best debate app ever!!!!!
4,Excellent, but can do with function to adjust time and bells Love this. Helps me a lot for my debate timing :) would help if we could change the timing too :)
5,Brilliant The best timer for debaters, adjudicators and official timers alike.
5,Perfect
5,Fantastic! As a coach, I can only do so many things at one time! Thank you so much for this. You have made my life exponentially easier! The only problem I have is that the bell is kind of quiet but that is probably more to with my phone than anything! Thank you, Mark
5,Excellent App Really excellent app. Hopefully will become standard on the debating circuit. Would be good to have an option for five minute British Parliamentary as a lot of schools competitions do that.
4,Great
5,Should be mandatory At all debate tournaments.
5,OMGOMGOMG This is really good. I timed debates, and goddammit they were timed well.
