5,New favourite calculator widget Since the last widget I tried went down the dreaded air push route I think I've managed to find one from a reputable place for the long run?!
5,Really nice-looking and simple The UI on this app is very clean.
5,Great and easy Keep on the good work, hope you add more scientific function. And more gridlines for better overlook of written equation.
5,Stock calc powered at thousand Useful calculator to everybody who needs calculate more than how costs a couple of cakes.
5,Very useful.. Much better than the stock android calc.. very useful features like determinant, matrices, graph of equations, etc.. very useful app.. simple UI
5,I'm good with this. Excellent replacement! I Thank the digital gods for developers (I wish some of these guys would get hired at the big phone companies.) The Big Time are more interested in cutting costs and maximizing profit by buy-in schemes loaded onto the rom. But not these guys All Hail Cyanogenmod!
5,Sizing Everything is great except for the size of the numbers that line the graphs its still gonna get 5 stars because I can still see it but some people might be able to maybe add that in the settings??
5,Great Stock calculator is like a botched third trimester abortion. This app fixed so many of the problems. thank you!

5,Best on the market, without question the best calculator. Love it. Just download it its free.
4,Great little app, especially for use as lock screen widget, but... I wished the lock screen widget was sized appropriately as far as fonts on my device (Nexus 5). ie: Delete button reads "DELET" with the continued "E" below it.
5,Great!!! Excellent. Matrices, graph, scientific all in one place..
5,Changed my life Revolutionized the way I do math. Fantastic app.
4,Inverse sin, cos, tan My life would be complete if I could do sin^-1 cos^-1 and tan^-1. Then I'd give 5/5. It's a great app though. Love it!
4,Nice application But please add infinite scrolling through panels. Also add some functions and constant values.
4,Great look and feel Way better than the stock calculator.
5,Better than stock Use this over stock because of the extra functions mainly % function is most useful over stock
5,Should be merged to stock Android. One of the best apps of all time.
