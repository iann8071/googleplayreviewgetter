5,nice works fine
5,Works! No comments needed
3,Decent; could be better The tablet version should use the HW back button to close the event info and not exit the app.
5,Awesome!
5,Like Shortest permission list I've ever seen on an android app
5,Worked great! Thank you very much for making the congress easier with this tool!
5,excellent Danke
5,Does the job Worked as expected, did all I needed. I wish the workshops were in the timeline, too. But apparently they're only in the wiki, which makes parsing a pain.
3,No timezone offset This app doesnt have a timezone offset which makes the alarms a little useless for watching the streams here in the uk, other than that its great
5,Very useful As the congress is coming to a close, I want to say thanks to the developers of the app. It was very useful for navigating the congress..
3,Add universal time Or anything that can help me work out the time difference as I'm in Australia.
4,Opens the wrong day Always opens day 2, even though it's day 3 already (Nexus S with ICS)
5,Thanks Nice app.
5,Works great.
