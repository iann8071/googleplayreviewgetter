5,Need donate version No problem with ads but don't be shy... offer a 0.49 or 0.99 cent donate version. Add feature like notification when you're over your relative pct
1,App can't login anymore Was working great but now wont login on 2 optimus V phones for 2 different accounts. 5 stars when it worked. Verified logon on web. HELP!!
5,Awesome app! This app is very well done. Small, works great, and is accessible with talkback. The text boxes are not labeled for phone # and password, but the first box automatically has the phone's number in it, so it is simple to figure out which is which. I wish more apps were this well done.
3,Doesn't Work Anymore When I first installed this app it worked fine and I liked how I could keep track of my minutes. Now it stopped working and will not connect or log in. Uninstalling until it is fixed. It is working on my phone again. I like the app, but I found another which I believe is better, and puts more information at your fingertips. Three and a half stars.
4,Needs multiple widgets Need ability to have widget for each account. And right before new month starts, coding shuts down on app and will not show any info
5,Virgin Mobile: HIRE this guy! I'm baffled that VM doesn't have something like this already. I love being able to check my remaining minutes at a glance and every time I make a call. This widget is a must-have!
5,It works great This is a great app to have! I only had an issue with it once where it wasn't working but a few hours later it was fine and no issues since. It's worth the download.
5,Problems with carrier Great app when virgin mobiles site is not broken... Cant sign on for over 3 weeks... Everything sprint owns is the worst poor voice and slow data
5,Fixed It appears. this app is now fixed and shows the correct pie chart info in the widget. Couldn't ask for anything more.
5,**AWESOME APP, EXCELLENT DEVELOPER** Virgin Mobile will never make a user-friendly app like this hoping you'll go over your minutes. What an excellent developer to create something that is surely a necessity. Thank you!
2,Can't log in! Please fix, love this app but its useless with being able to see how many minutes I have.
3,Great app Would be 5 stars but since an update or two ago, minutes always show up as red and the black month cycle bar to gauge where your at in the month has disappeared. Being able to see minutes during and after a call are still very helpful though! I'm able to log in just fine, not sure what everyone else is talking about
5,Should come standard on VM smart phones. Bloody br Keeping the five star rating but this app shouldn't be working for anyone due to the system updates Virgin Mobile have been doing to their entire system (website, towers, automated voice menus, and (TOTAL LACK OF) customer service). Developer may be working on how to fix the issue, but I think it's just as likely VM have totally borked things up. If you check their facebook site, TONS of complaints.
3,Please update this! Since Virgin changed its site, the login is broken. Without an update to correct this, the app is useless. That is a shame because when it works it's great. If and when it gets updated, my original review will stand: Awesome! Makes what should be a basic function, but is actually quite a pain, something that takes no effort at all. Thanks!
1,Not logging me in I had this app for 2 weeks on my Kyocera Rise and it worked great, but all of a sudden it stopped working. Wouldn't let me log in. Tells me that I do not have the correct username or password, which I know I do because I can log into the site just fine. Not sure if update messed something up or because I'm not using an Optimus.
1,Fixed on XDA! Some body took the time to fix the app over at XDA! There error is from VM switching from www to www2 in the web address so the original app can't pull the account. Many have said they emailed the dev but never responded and no update. It's clear it's abandoned for now Google for this app fixed on xda and enjoy it again!
5,Stopped working after VM update yesterday BACK UP TO FIVE STARS! I was so sad when I had to give a one star rating after years of joyous use, but when the VM update went through in April, this app stopped working. I am happy to report it is now back up and running!!!! Thanks
1,Stopped working I loved this app. I'm assuming it's because virgin mobile updated their system. I hope this can be fixed. This made my life much simpler. I will change to 5 stars once it's resolved.
2,Please fix!!! Used to LOVE this app! Since Virgin Mobile updated their system I cannot log in at all. It is super inconvenient and frustrating. Seems many are having this problem. Please fix this problem ASAP developer. Hate to delete the app:-(
1,WHATS GOING ON? Its keeps saying wrong password but its right I used to have it on my phone and it was great now it wont let me sign in :'(
