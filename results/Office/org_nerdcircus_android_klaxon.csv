4,So very close to doing exactly what I need This works wonderfully, for one number (or forwarded e-mail address). Plays the sound you want or vibrates as you want it to, and when it goes off, it works wonderfully. I can only ask for one other thing, due to the way the company I work for does things, there's never just one number or sender. Never just one subject either. If I could add multiple numbers and multiple criteria, it would be absolutely perfect. Otherwise, it's exactly what I need. And I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a constant reminder to wake you up in the middle of the night when something breaks, or someone runs into a work stopping apocalyptic problem.
5,just what I wished existed I had a working text to wake my a$$ up solution for my system alerts at work. But it was through Tasker and was complex as heck. That is not a slam on tasker - it can be great if you put in the time. But this is all I wanted. Brilliant way of using the 'Alarm' volume to make a sound to wake me up when I need it to. This outsmarts the really dumbed down Android sound settings which I hate. That is the only thing I miss from Blackberry. post something in the app so I can donate to you.
5,Outstanding App This is an outstanding pager app. Finally, an app that can actually replace my pager. Pros: - Can use alarm volume level even when phone is on silent or asleep. - Will repeat the alarm at intervals you select, so that if you miss it the first time you will eventually catch it again. - Can stop the SMS message from going to other apps such as the messaging app. This way it is only in the pager app and you don't have to clean it out of multiple lists. Features that could be added to make it totally perfect: - Multiple triggers. My boss works in IT and is a member of two volunteer firefighter departments, so for him, having multiple triggers for multiple senders would be good. - A widget that could allow you to turn on call on and off, so that you don't have to go through the menu to do it. - Displaying the message even when the phone is locked and allowing confirmation, similar to how a phone call shows up and allows you to answer it even when the phone is locked. These are minor things though... the feature set overall is excellent and does just what I need. I especially like the interval feature, much better than FireAlert's continuous duration feature.
5,Useful for persistent calendar reminders too I've started using Klaxon to get repeating reminders for calendar events: - in Google Calendar's web interface, add SMS reminders to important events. - in Klaxon's SMS settings, set "Reminder:" as the sender, and check "also match message body". Then you'll get an appropriately obnoxious reminder that persists until you view the message, not just Calendar's single beep that's too easy to miss. Not sure if this is a supported use case, but this could make the app useful for people who don't need a pager too :-)
5,Great SMS paging app great and worth getting. Makes SMS paging quicker and easier. Very helpful to those who have multiple pages' to handle whilst on call. you can also choose via the preferences section to consume the SMS texts from other apps resulting in your inbox staying empty while you go "on-call".
5,Makes SMS a good oncall page solution I've always been concerned that when I get a text I will miss it. This makes sure that I respond when a text message is sent. It has always worked well. And very nice that I can just turn it off when not on call
5,Great for being in-call I have been using this app for the past 2+ years for call... best app! Would like the ability to export call log. Droid incredible - VZW.
3,Needs to support multiple senders Works great for a single sender, but no obvious option to support another.
5,I use this every day Only missing feature (imo) is to be able to popup the alert on top of the phone lock screen (and wake up the screen).
1,Not find matching SMS I am trying to get this to work for emailed SMS message and it will not match. I try different about give different keywords WI success...too bad... This product looked nice
5,This app.... Great app!!!! Better than my work pager!! Great really is...I use it in a hospital :) am excuse to play on my phone!!
3,New samsung s3 os update disabled feature that usrd alarm volume for noyificationd ... New samsung s3 os update disabled feature that usrd alarm volume for noyificationd even if your main volume was turned off. This was a great way to not hear the phone either ring or email notifs but sounded when text came in (like a pager). Hopefully an update will follow to fix.
5,Great way to not miss texts Get text alerts for work and thus makes sure you don't miss any.
5,No more work pager Thank you for a great app. Works well with Android 4.0.4 on Samsung Galaxy 2.
1,Does not work on galaxy nexus. Even after setup my sms notifications do not change
5,Just what I need I needed an app that would work for my Android phone as our paging company does not have adequate service in many areas I travel to. This app fills the need nicely.
4,Just what I needed Could have a couple more bells and whistles, although very close to 5stars. Would like absorb pages when not oncall and see multiple rules for incoming txts.
4,On/Off Please!!! add on/off toggle widget. it is a real pain to have to go Klaxon/Menu/Preferences/On call just to turn the thing on and off. Otherwise great.
3,Was perfect This is a great app to have for my IT on call rotation, but now that I have upgraded my phone from a Galaxy S2 to a Galaxy S4 it no longer uses the alarm volume option. Once fixed for my phone I will give it 5 stars again.
3,it stopped working Everything was fine until beginning of July ... now the pages are going back to SMS :( ...
