5,Stopped keeping tablet awake, and doesn't chime at Had some issues with app keeping my device awake as desired. Dev jumped in and fixed it within a day. Now I'm very pleased with it. Edit: After using the app for a number of months... I am nearsighted. Having the circle animation make it much easier to quickly note how far along I am in my session. While I have considered other apps, because I like the idea of having a tracking component, the animation keeps me with this one.
2,Sound stopped working after update No other apps running. Fresh reboot. Other apps sound works fine. Verified sound volume is up. Verified app sound settings are set. But no longer makes start or stop sounds test or live. Wish I hadn't updated.
5,Great minimal application This does exactly what I want it to do. No less, no more.
4,Elegant design and useful Elegant design and useful!
5,Thank you for making this beautiful and simple app. I was looking for a ... Thank you for making this beautiful and simple app. I was looking for a timer with a pleasant sound to end my meditation.
4,One request Beautifully simple timer, but would you please add the option (check box) to run the three preset timers consecutively? I would like to set first for 30 sec to get settled, the second for the first half of the session and the third for the second half.
5,Simple and effective. Just what I was looking for.
5,Just what i wanted. I was going to get my nephew to write me ... Just what i wanted. I was going to get my nephew to write me an app that does just this.
5,Everything that's needed in a meditation timer.
5,Elegant Timer can auto repeat. Elegant design.
5,Perfect timer. This is exactly what I've been looking for in a meditation timer. It has everything I need and nothing I don't.
5,Fantastic! This is exactly what I was looking for! There is a nice variety of sounds, so I can choose what I need for today. The app is very simple and straightforward. I am especially happy that I don't have to have all my notifications on to hear the sounds. Other timers are set to notifications, not media. Overall, lovely lovely!
5,Very elegant Thank you. I use this app every day.
5,A fantastic app Only prob... Had to reset the "media volume" (gear symbol that shows when a volume button is pressed) on my Sammy Note 8 as I had it set to 0 and couldn't hear the sounds.
5,Minimalist, elegant, ad free I love this timer! It is simple, to the point and very easy to use. It allows flexibility in how you are notified; vibrate, sound, popup, LED flash arecall options. My favorite feature is that you can adjust the sound volume as a % of your device media sound volume, so if you want it to be quiter than most sounds you don't have to readjust device settings when starting/finishing with the timer.
5,Simple and pretty Excellent program. I like it better than all the other timers on the market
5,Beautiful
5,Love this app After the latest update the sound volume is really low - even though it's turned to max, as are all my other volumes, including media players. Still love this app tho. The sounds are fantastic, the bell-sound resonates as if I had a monk in the room timing me with a meditation bowl. Beautiful.
4,Great Please add the option to play a sound each 'x' time (in cycles) during the count down period.
5,Clean and simple Exactly what I was looking for...a simple, straight-forward meditation timer, with start and end bells and a few presets. This is really all you need.
4,Good overall Nice features. Very responsive developer. One issue - widget's CPU usage is high.
4,Good design, would like one more feature. Nice to be able to choose your own sound. As a feature request, I would like to be able to choose which presets play sound and which don't, so that I can set a silent preparation time. As a workaround, I can set a short preset before the long preset sitting period, and set the sounds only to play at the end of the presets, but then I can't choose a different sound for the beginning and end of the sitting period. But anyway, Good Job!
4,Like this, but sound doesn't always work I love the elegance of this timer, but now when I preset meditation times, it counts down but there is no sound at the end of the meditation period. It was working fine before.
3,Sound does not work after last update This is a great app. Evrything is working fine until the last update. The sound does not work when countdown is done. Please fix this.
5,Best timer! Melodious sounds, and elegant graphics, and simplicity of us make this app. my favorite. Thanks for adding a separate volume so I can listen to music while the timer is running!
3,Lovely, but.. Really great timer, but the widget doesn't work, which is a shame because it's so pretty. Will rate 5 stars when widget works on my experia ion
5,Love this simple timer! Excellent and light weight timer is quite pleasing to hear. Thank you!
5,Great app Adding volume control for the bell/sound will make it perfect.
5,Beautiful simplicity Elegant and useful timer. It does everything I need. Nothing more. Simply Perfect.
4,Great! Simple yet useful. My only request is that more versions of singing bowls be added, perhaps two more with a lower pitch
5,the perfect timer simple, easy, lightweight and gorgeous, it's become my favourite alarm app. i use it at work, in meditation and for cooking. great.
5,Well done Simple and clean. Nice sounds. Thank you.
5,Best for long time sitting Nice and clear design after become used, no much words. Simplicity is great. This is great app for vipassana continuous for long sitting. Though no stages in between. Would like to hear bells of a better quality. No ads which would not be possible. Excellent keep on!
5,It's working with my Motorola Milestone 3 Thanks to Yuttadhammo, I can now use it on my phone for timing my meditation sessions. He has patiently sorted out the problem I had with the phone's notification ringtone overriding the application's tones using the 'force custom tone' feature. It took about four changes, but now it's perfect. I hope others will try making it part of their own meditation practice. Excellent, Greg.
4,Simple and beautiful.... Wonderful little app. I just wish I could have a setting that would give the option of playing the soft chime and bell sounds throughout meditation.
5,Love it! Super useful for staying on track for tasks as well. Have recommended it to friends. Please don't add on more permissions.
5,Clear as a bell Hits the spot with sound and clean UI. Thank you brother!
5,Simple and works It does what it supposed to, great little app. Thanks!
3,Good but... Not as good as Zazen Meditation Timer.
5,Simplicity in itself Very good. No tricks. God bless yer cotton socks.
5,Awesome. Easy. Simple
2,Limited Would work well if this app allowed variations in timers. For Instance: 2 Minutes + 2:30 Min + 2 Min + 2:30 Min + 20 Min.
5,Love it! The best meditation timer on Android.
5,Works great!
4,Simple & effective Easy to set.
