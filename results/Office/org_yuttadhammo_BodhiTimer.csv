5,Stopped keeping tablet awake, and doesn't chime at Had some issues with app keeping my device awake as desired. Dev jumped in and fixed it within a day. Now I'm very pleased with it. Edit: After using the app for a number of months... I am nearsighted. Having the circle animation make it much easier to quickly note how far along I am in my session. While I have considered other apps, because I like the idea of having a tracking component, the animation keeps me with this one.
2,Sound stopped working after update No other apps running. Fresh reboot. Other apps sound works fine. Verified sound volume is up. Verified app sound settings are set. But no longer makes start or stop sounds test or live. Wish I hadn't updated.
5,Great minimal application This does exactly what I want it to do. No less, no more.

4,One request Beautifully simple timer, but would you please add the option (check box) to run the three preset timers consecutively? I would like to set first for 30 sec to get settled, the second for the first half of the session and the third for the second half.
5,Simple and effective. Just what I was looking for.

5,Everything that's needed in a meditation timer.
5,Elegant Timer can auto repeat. Elegant design.
5,Perfect timer. This is exactly what I've been looking for in a meditation timer. It has everything I need and nothing I don't.
5,Fantastic! This is exactly what I was looking for! There is a nice variety of sounds, so I can choose what I need for today. The app is very simple and straightforward. I am especially happy that I don't have to have all my notifications on to hear the sounds. Other timers are set to notifications, not media. Overall, lovely lovely!
5,Very elegant Thank you. I use this app every day.
5,A fantastic app Only prob... Had to reset the "media volume" (gear symbol that shows when a volume button is pressed) on my Sammy Note 8 as I had it set to 0 and couldn't hear the sounds.
5,Minimalist, elegant, ad free I love this timer! It is simple, to the point and very easy to use. It allows flexibility in how you are notified; vibrate, sound, popup, LED flash arecall options. My favorite feature is that you can adjust the sound volume as a % of your device media sound volume, so if you want it to be quiter than most sounds you don't have to readjust device settings when starting/finishing with the timer.
5,Simple and pretty Excellent program. I like it better than all the other timers on the market
5,Beautiful
5,Love this app After the latest update the sound volume is really low - even though it's turned to max, as are all my other volumes, including media players. Still love this app tho. The sounds are fantastic, the bell-sound resonates as if I had a monk in the room timing me with a meditation bowl. Beautiful.
4,Great Please add the option to play a sound each 'x' time (in cycles) during the count down period.
5,Clean and simple Exactly what I was looking for...a simple, straight-forward meditation timer, with start and end bells and a few presets. This is really all you need.
