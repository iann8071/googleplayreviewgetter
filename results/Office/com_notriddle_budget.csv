4,Extremely useful Easy to use, nice minimalist design. I wish there was a way to have separate screens for different accounts- one for business, one for savings, checking, etc. It would also be helpful if I could change the order of the "envelopes". Otherwise a great app.
5,Perfect A simple and powerful app for expense tracking. Thanks!
3,Save money by using this application
5,Great Ad free. The transfer between envelopes feature is fantastic. Like other posters I would say: simple, intuitive, useful. I tried others, but kept this one. I agree a couple more colors might be a nice upgrade sometime.**Update** Thank you developer for the new colors!
5,Excellent app! I have been looking for an "envelope budgeting" system, and this is the best! It is so easy to stay within my budget, because I see how much I've spent, and how much is left. A wonderful money management app.
5,Perfect, don't change it!! This app looks great, is simple as heck to use, and does exactly what I need. I can't say that too often about most apps.
5,So very simple! Love it, easy & intuitive. I've tried all the budget/envelope apps and this is by far the best.
5,Just installed I just installed this app & looks like what I've been looking for.
5,Wonderful Bloat-free and no-nonsense. Simply works. Best envelope budgeting app out there. Could do with extra colours
4,Wonderful Don't let the interface fool you. It's simple and intuitive but gets the job done! It's not fancy-looking but the ones that are over complicate things and cause me not to use them. This one's a keeper.
5,Best envelope budget app This app is the best of the envelope budget apps for Android! (I tried about 12 different ones) This one has an ultra simple, easy to use interface, that sets it apart from the rest. I use this app more than any other on my phone. If you are a Dave Ramsey follower and want digital envelopes, this is your app. The developer is awesome at responding as well. Quit reading, download now! :-)
4,Beautiful & Clean This is exactly what I've been endlessly searching the app store for! I'd give it 5 stars but looking for one key feature, the ability for all or individual envelopes to reset weekly (or monthly, biweekly, etc.) to a user-defined amount.
5,I like it Very simple but it's a great start! It helps me keep expenses under control already. Please add some way to split new paychecks into envelopes without typing. Something using sliders. Oh and we don't need a button to create new envelopes. I think transfers between envelopes are more used so put an icon for that and put the new envelope button into the menu.
1,Crap app is useless. Pics in description do not match actual function. No reoccurring transactions. Easier to use paper and pencil.
5,frilink I like it, it's simple and straight to the point, the simplicity of this app really appeals to me, I've been using envelope system (manually) for quite some time now, trust me, this app is great.
