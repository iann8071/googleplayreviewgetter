4,HTC Flyer Loving using this app with my HTC Flyer pen, but I'm having some problems: The app won't rotate into landscape mode. Obviously it's not too difficult to draw with the app "sideways," but since some of the screenshots are in landscape I assume the app should support this. The drag-to-resize brush size seems to be acting up. The size always comes up a lot smaller or a lot bigger than I was expecting (like, 0.4, or 256.) Maybe if there were some way to see what the size will be before you release the pen?
