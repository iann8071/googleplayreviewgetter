4,bring org with you Syncing orgmode to my phone via dropbox finally makes it a viable planner for me. I didn't have much luck setting up a webdav folder, but Dropbox integration is very easy.
1,Agenda and capture I didn't want it for todos but to view and maybe edit regular outlines of mine. If that's not supported, please say so in the description of the app so we don't waste our time. Couldn't get it to work either.
5,fabulous app Thanks a lot for this great app. It did take some efforts for me to get it going (I am new to even org-mode). But the effort was certainly worth it. I was so happy to see even the calendar integration working nicely. One feature I'd like to have is entry-level encryption that org-crypt provides. That'd make password storage easier. Anyway, thanks again - I just love the app.
3,Can't be used with my 'Ubuntu One' I don't know why,this version can't be fit with my Ubuntu One' which was no problem in the past . When i try to log in the Ubuntu One account in my mobile, it shows "log in successful!".but when I go next ,there is nothing listed for selecting to synch.
5,So useful I could not live without it The negative reviews here blow my mind. While I will admit mobile-org itself is a bit rough to deal with that is hardly the fault of this client. I use this app every day for capture and calendar and it just works if you follow the instructions. Thanks for an excellent app.
3,Seriously, what? Emacs Org-Mode is one of the greatest pieces of software ever designed. It's sleek, it's powerful, it's productive, and it's enough to dispel all rumours that Emacs is too geeky for average people to use. So logic would follow that the Android app would be *even more* user-friendly and slick, right? Uh, I couldn't, um, get this thing to work. I'm a long-time Linux and Emacs geek, and this thing just doesn't work and the documentation isn't very useful. MobileOrg's user interface itself is confusing. Setting up the environment in server side is providing me *no* results so far. I've never needed as much headaches with Emacs packages since, uh, 1998 or so. The *concept* is nothing less than awesome, though. OrgMode does everything. Having a mobile companion to an app that does everything would be absolutely sweet. I really hope there will be new versions of this app that don't require an *ungodly hassle* to set up and have an actually great user interface that doesn't confuse me endlessly. But while waiting for that, I think I'll stick to other apps. Shame, really. Great concept, but it's not there yet.
1,I thought I'd be able to edit org files But instead there's some impenetrable logic involving "captures". Or maybe no logic at all, because that would manifest a similar appearance.
1,Crashes a lot
5,Great app
1,Wipes previously-captured items 0.9.5/0.9.6 seem to have automatically wiped all my capture items. Terrible data-loss bug. Do not auto-update this app.
5,Terrific improvement The new interface is terrific. Got me back to using mobileorg again. Thanks for this awesome app.
5,Excellent app for org-mode for emacs users If you use org-mode for emacs, this app is essential. Latest update improved a lot the visual interface.
2,No longer text based The main point of org-mode is that it is storing the data in simple text files, which can be synchronized with version control and edited with any text editor. Putting the data into a database invalidates this concept.
3,Ok It is a good idea but the formatting and displaying of my org files never seem to be ok... and my files are not terribly complex...
5,Login failed: Network error: null When I tried to sync with dropbox, I got this error. Dropbox app works fine. But still it's great!
5,Must have app I use it with org-mode, and it's great! Still programming. I think i will buy donate version later.
5,Amazing progress. Keep programming! MobileOrg becomes useable and very nice additional for org-mode on desktop.
5,ubuntuone support is great must have!
1,Not working. Not working on Samsung Galaxy Tab 7+
5,Great app Much better than iOS version.
