5,Great little app Really simple to use and great for keeping a record of fuel consumption. Nice to be able to manage multiple cars
5,Brilliant I have just started using this app and already see you can import and export data. Fantastic. Was using fuel log app backed up all my data but was unable to import the data back in after rooting my phone. Data lost. So for 2014 I will be using this app and hopefully for ever more. Thank you
5,very helpful use the app for budgeting, monitoring car performance and for peace of mind/entertainment. thanks to kraemer and github a lot and even more for not commercializing it
5,Thank you! Very well designed; easy to use; HELPFUL app!
2,All in all good, but... There appears to be no option to change the currency to e.g Euros which I would require. Without that option the app loses loses its usefulness for me.
5,Excellent!! This app saves me so much paper & calculating @ the pump. I always check my mileage. This is so easy.
5,Nice Off lil on how mucg miles i drive by like 4 but i love it really starting to help me save money
5,Thumbs up! This app is truly a useful tool. Thank you!
5,Just what I was looking for! I was using another app but really wanted an application to calculate my monthly gas costs. This one fits the bill.

4,Great little app Simple to use and works great so far. Thanks Will for taking some time to code this one!
5,The best so far The best fuel consumption app I've found so far - will take litres input and still convert to mpg. More precise figures such as costings also available if required. Thanks for making this app for us
5,Simple and clean Upgraded to five stars after the most recent update! Is there a way to backup the data onto an SD card? So I can use it with different ROMs?
2,Not that good Does not allow you to enter fuel price.
4,Great! Only thing missing is a place for " Price per Gallon."
