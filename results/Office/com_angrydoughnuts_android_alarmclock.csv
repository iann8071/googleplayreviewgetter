5,Great Alarm Simple, fast n light weight. Does its job.
5,Others have candy coating, this 1 works! Other alarm apps have pretty candy coatings, but they are a pain and limited on customization. This gives you repeat options, easy tone selections, and customizable snooze length. Easy. Works!
5,Favourite alarm app Best and easiest alarm app hands down.
5,works, no ads, easy to use perfect
2,Great design poor function I tried every alarm out there. I love the design of this one. Only problem is the snooze don't ever work. Therefore I have to set numerous alarms to make sure I don't sleep too long. Fix that and I would give it a five. Using on a LG intuition.
5,I like it very much The one on my S2 is good but only allows 8 alarms and I have combinations of alarms so this excellently simple to set up and use alarm is great and free. Having tested quite a few of the ad supported ones, this one beats all of them hands down, oh and did I say that it is free :) Now that the lock screen issue has been fixed I have deservedly increased it to 5 stars. WELL done.
5,Great alarm app Does everything I want with no fuss or bugs. Thanks, developer!
5,The Best One Best alarm for me since SGS1.
5,Perfecta Siempre ha sido indispensable en todos los smartphones que he tenido. No la cambio por nada, y he probado varias. Se ha actualizado despu?s de mucho tiempo solucionando alg?n problema de volumen en el HTC One, por ejemplo. Sigue sin la opci?n de copias de seguridad de tus alarmas.
4,Perfect now attractive too . minus point no scheduler.
4,Good, very accurate than others. The new UI is great but with this update I'm not able to snooze or disable alarm. JB 4.1.2 nandroid backup.
5,Good I guess I love it
5,Quality app Quality app
5,Love this app I don't know if that's a bug, but I have to add an alarm twice in order for it to show up
5,Favorite Alarm I love this one because it's so hard to accidentally turn it off while not really awake.
5,Best Love the small size, fade in customization, and integration with my audio files. Best alarm clock on the market.
5,Perfect Finally my favorite alarm klock works 100% with kitkat. Than you!
5,Simple and reliable Tried using other alarms and either their snooze kills the alarm after two hits or just gives up on you... Not this app ! Get it.
4,Not reliable Still the most useful alarm out there. Nice UI update.
5,Amazing Works every time just as an alarm clock should
1,Uninstalling This is the alarm i needed it allows me to choose my own music as the alarm. Sally i have to uninstall and 1 star because of phone view. When the alarm goes off it automatically rotated my screen to phone view that its an instant uninstall and 1 star. If i wanted phone view i would have bought a phone
5,Better than phone alarm Much better. Thank you
5,Works great Use it everyday
5,The best Hands down, the best alarm
4,best try
2,please update! I've relied on this alarm for over 2 years now, recently it has been force closing which is causing the alarm to not go off. I have never had any issues with this alarm please fix it before have to find something else!
5,Works As Expected Been using this alarm clock app for several years across three or four different smart phones. Never crashes. Never had any problems. This may be the best app I've ever downloaded in terms of being problem-free.
5,Great alarm clock! Probably the best feature is the "slide to turn off" rather than a tap button. I have accidentally turned of other alarms while half asleep, and this one stops me from doing so, which is great!
5,Simple, easy, fun to use Reminds me of the old Dream Machine alarm clocks that would ramp up the volume until the human got up. I like that feature the most. Thanks!
4,Very well done with one issue An excellent alarm, highly configurable. Allows for alarms which turn off after each use, as the iPhone does. The vibration alarm however is far too weak on my galaxy s2. Stock alarm vibrates much stronger. Otherwise perfect.
0,Force closed this a.m. almost causing me to lose my job. Not good. However, ... Force closed this a.m. almost causing me to lose my job. Not good. However, 1st time its ever happened. Just hope it doesn't happen again.
5,I have been using it for the past eight months or so almost daily. ... I have been using it for the past eight months or so almost daily. No problems whatsoever. SE X10 mini, Android 1.6 and 2.1.
5,Best alarm clock I have tried a lot of alarm clocks and this one is my fav. It's clean, simple and not overloaded with pointless features.
3,Please fix snooze in ics! I've used this app and relied on it for a couple of years, but since I upgraded to Ice Cream Sandwich snooze doesn't work anymore. I can't give it a higher rating without that essential function working.
4,Memory is precious on my "old" phone (18m!), so I needed a simple alarm ... Memory is precious on my "old" phone (18m!), so I needed a simple alarm app to replace "Alarm Clock Plus", which is a bloated 2.8MB. Alarm Klock is just 340KB installed. It's not pretty, but it seems to do just about all the basics that you need in an alarm app, without unnecessary frills. I especially like the slide-to-cancel function - this requires a deliberate action, so you don't accidentally cancel instead of snoozing the alarm when you're not awake! There are a couple of flaws. As well as alarm- and ring- tones, the alarm tone picker incorrectly displays sounds that can't be used, like the HTC volume button sounds, and picks up links to radio stations from the "TuneIn Radio" app. So the pick list is rather cluttered. DEV pls separate the sounds, perhaps using pop up "which program?" menu box, like other apps that play sounds? Also the lock screen notification does something strange and squashes the unlock pattern - very odd. But overall it's great! Dev - fix these issues and it'll be a 5-star app. (HTC Legend, 2.2) This hasn't been updated for a long time - I hope the Dev hasn't abandoned this app...?
5,Simple and clever The author has thought through the features I need: -big snooze button -impossible to dissmiss by a button miss - you need to swipe to dissmiss -no nonsense However I miss a little feature. To dissmiss a snoozed alarm you need to wait till it fires again. You can't do it otherwise. I hope author will extend his nice app a bit. 5 stars. PS: It's interesting that I tried quite a few other advanced alarms, but they could not get the simple things right.
2,Snooze fail Loved this on HTC Desire. Now hitting snooze, or even just picking the phone up turns the alarm off. Often don't even know I've done it. Would be grateful for a fix as thinking of finding another app now but used to like this so much. ICS HTC One S.
4,Needs skip next occurence button Instead of unsetting, waiting and setting to on again. needs skip next occurrence button and would be perfect. tiny dl and easy-to the point alarm setup...
5,The best I've tried many alarms and have been frustrated with all but this one. Simple, fast and reliable. Why no one else has been able to accomplish these basic things is beyond me.
4,Literally is an Android selling point for me This is the best alarm clock I've ever had, I really like it. I want to give it 5 stars but unfortunately I'm having issues with snooze like some other users seem to be reporting. Snooze will work fine for weeks then suddenly not work. This morning I hit the +5 button a few times to increase my snooze from 10 minutes to 30 minutes and the alarm rang the second time but it rang silently, when I looked at my phone Alarm Klock said the the alarm had timed out. This is after a good 8 hour sleep and going to bed like a good boy should on a work night so I know it wasn't me not hearing it. This is quite bad because I came into work half an hour late, thankfully I didn't sleep for too long. I want to take away 2 stars but to be fair I've used this app for so long and like it's design so much that I'm only taking away 1 star. Am just going to be very weary of using snooze from now on or will have to test it a good few times before using it again. This is a pain. Using HTC Desire would greatly appreciate a fix but thanks for a great app.
5,Good basic, reliable, safe alarm clock Straightforward, capable, simple to use, reliable. Like "Fabrice Carrasco" said in recent review, Alarm Klock was recently flagged by Avast! as a potentially unsafe program (PUP). On Friday 4/5/2013 there was an Avast! update in the wee hours of the morning which caused this. Not one to ignore security warnings, I removed Alarm Klock and went back to the stock alarm clock. I'm also not one to believe much without verifying. So looked around and saw that the program author had replied on his Google group that this was a false positive and to contact the security software vendor. So I contacted Avast! support who confirmed this to be a false postive which should be already fixed. Sure enough, after doing a manual Avast! update, Alarm Klock is no longer flagged as a PUP and all is well. Now I have to decide whether to keep Avast! On my phone. I like having the free additional security protection but I used this as my alarm clock and am not happy that it shut down Alarm Klock causing my alarm not to go off in the morning on that day.
2,Big problem - snooze stops working after a while Loved this app in the beginning, BUT... After a couple of weeks of perfection, snooze suddenly just stopped working (without any indication of Force Close). When I changed snooze duration, it started working again, but now I don't know when it will or won't work, and if you can't trust your alarm clock, you might as well not use it. I'm afraid I'll have to change back to the stock app until this issue is solved. There is an issue posted to the developer's site on this problem, but it's been there since March with a "New" status and only a Medium priority. I can't think of anything that is higher priority for an alarm clock app than its reliability. This is really too bad, as otherwise I really liked this app. Running on HTC Dream with Android 2.2.1 (CyanogenMod 6).
5,Simply the best, at least for me Many alarm clocks had done many things right, but there was always something missing, such as: custon ringtone, 24 h clock, acceptable permissions, a proper snooze screen, ad-free etc. The Alarm Klock has it all and even a managed to suprise me with some pro features like rising volume over a time YOU can define yourself. I also liked the slider for dismissing an alarm, since you don't slide it by accident. Tip for the developer: So far your priorities have been right. Don't spend any time on polishing the graphics if you can spend the same time working on functionality. There are plenty of competitors out there who have done the exact opposite. They will have their users and you will have yours. These audiences are dissimilar so don't think some fancy eye-candy app is diminishing your market share. You don't need to compete with them, since you have something many don't, and that's functionality.
1,Problems after 4.4 update... This has always been my favorite alarm clock app, however since the 4.4 KitKat update it force closes whenever you try to change the default alarm sound (which is not loud or effective enough for me, being a heavy sleeper). EVERY time I have tried to change the default sound, the app has force closed. Please fix this!
4,Been using for over 2 years Its awesome. However, the gradual increase in volume doesn't work on RAZR HD like it did on my DROID X
5,Daily driver Excellent clock . This one I use and am going to keep for long . V happy with this app Excellent alarm tune. Especially love the snooze button 5 stars ..no hesitation
5,Perfect, Free, Thanks I could stands slightly nicer buttons, a more discrete icon in the notification bar, and a bit more choice on repetition, but 5* and thanks anyway.
5,Great! small and works great. An extra request: while setting a new alarm time, add a button likes 30 mins later and so onto make it easier.
5,Best Alarm App EVER!! I've been using this App for over 3 years now, and it's never let me down! Thanks for the awesome app! ;) HTC EVO 3D.
4,Awesome..but Sometimes, not all the time when you snooze once the alarm turns off instead of snoozing. 99% reliable. Very good app.
4,Awesome This by far is the easiest and best alarm clock I have used, love the big snooze button and easy dismiss button, the only thing I wish it would do is be able to still work when the phone is switched off so that my alarm would still go off in the morning even when I switch my phone off for the night, instead I have to remember to turn my phone on in the early hours of the morning so the alarm works
5,Superb! Superb! Only one lag was noticed - doesn't work when Android system dialog message is on. So do not miss your alarm when you'll be notified about low battery ;)
3,Was good Was awesome until I downloaded hd widgets then for some unknown reason it dismisses instead of snoozes. Had to find another one now. Shame
5,Perfect I love this alarm clock. The author has had the sense to keep it simple and lite. Bravo! Still very flexible, and does just the things yoy need. I've had it since my first Android, and I am keeping it. 5 stars.
5,Really nice I hate to get out of the bed, however, I hate rude alarm clocks. Alarm Klock allows for a nice gentle alarm, as well as snoozes.
5,Love it! Couldn't ask for more. Totally reliable. Easy to use. Can set up multiple alarms. The alarm sound is pleasant. Couldn't function w/out it.
3,Suddenly unreliable I used this app for ages on my Droid Incredible and I loved it, I loved the giant snooze button and the simplicity of the features. But I recently upgraded to a Droid DNA and suddenly the snooze feature doesn't actually snooze, just disables the alarm until the next day. But only SOMETIMES; every now and then, the snooze button actually snoozes and the alarm sounds again in a few minutes. I trusted this app for so long, and it's killing me now that I can't rely on it.
5,Simple but feature rich I love this alarm clock! I use it for everything. Very easy to use immediately, but very customizable! Love it!
5,Perfect on my Nexus S. Love chowing own sound. I like gentle music. Hate waking up annoyed.
5,Works everytime Hasn't failed me yet and its been a couple of years now. Great alarm and simple to use. Perfect
5,"Just Works" Using it for almost a year, works perfectly. Fully customisable (snooze time, alarm sound and volume fade, daily repeats). Difficult to accidentally turn off - snooze is a button, alarm off is a slider. Samsung i5800
4,An excellent alarm click for my android, been using it for few months now, ... An excellent alarm click for my android, been using it for few months now, with some extra options I'll give it 5 stars
5,Excellent Sane permissions No ads Very easy to set new alarm Very easy to hit huge snooze button when sleepy Not oversimplified Not overcomplicated After trying lots of apps finally settled on this one Does very good job Doesn't annoy me :-) I wish all apps were like this Thanks!!
3,Was great, but now.. :( I've been using this app for years. First on my Lg Optimus S. I recently upgraded to an HTC Droid DNA, and at first I had no problems. But lately the snooze has been failing me. I'll click snooze, and according to the icon in the shade, it will beep again in 5min, but in 5min nothing happens and now the shade only list the next alarm I have set. I rely on my snooze way too much to have it fail. At first it seemed to fail randomly but lately it seems constantly. Looking for a new alarm app now. :(
1,Used to be the best Pre-ICS, this was my favorite alarm app. With ICS, the snooze works some of the time & not others. Very unreliable. Using Alarm Extreme now, but I hope you fix this. You were my fav!
4,Great app but occasional crash It crashes or resets occasionally and thus misses its alarm time after one press of the snooze. Otherwise it's awesome
2,Sensation ics One of best app, used it on all previos phones and on sensation until last upgrade to ics, now snooze option not working, pls fix it
2,Meh... I hate snooze functions and have no need for one. This app doesn't allow you to disable it, however, but rather forces a gigantic SNOOZE button on every triggered alarm. Fortunately there are better alternatives.
5,Simple yet efficient This app is easy to use, yet well customizable. My favorite alarm clock for Android!
5,Amazing! I LOVE it and it works perfectly but instead of giving me an "off" button, why does it make me force close? Other than that, it's great!
5,It just work I've veen using tjis spp since 2010 sweet app simple to use love it.
5,Very nice app! I particularly like the layout of the screen with the snooze button so much bigger than the dismiss. Some other alarms have a math option for severe problem awakeners, this is not a feature I personally care about anyhow but if it were added to this one then it could be the undisputed king of alarm apps. Too bad the author chose not to upload an icon to the market because he would probably get more downloads if he did!
5,This app is simple, and will ring even when my phone is on silent... ... This app is simple, and will ring even when my phone is on silent... hasn't let me down for a month since I got it. Will keep you updated. :)
4,Great! Like it so far, dunno how many alarms can be created yet?
5,Works great on HTC Droid Incredible 2 I have been using this to wake up for work all week, and it has worked great the whole time. The alarm is very easy to set and use.
3,Need a fix to be 5 stars The volume fade doesn't work. I've even set it to go from 0 to 50 over 1min an it always starts loud
2,Snooze kills the alarm - please fix Loved this app but no longer triggers the alarm after snooze on my S3. I think since jelly bean upgrade.
3,A few bugs Good alarm. Easy to use but lately its been dismissing instead of silencing them for 10 min. Please fix!
5,Superb Alarm Clock App!!! This app is super simple to use and allows one to title the alarm! I wish a count down timer was made with same titling ability thus eliminating the need to think of what the time will be when a simple 30 minute task will be complete. Instead just hit the titled countdown timer and you're golden. Please consider this. Thanks for you for your hard work with your current app and keeping things simple unlike a lot of paid alarm clocks! You rock!
1,WARNING Alarm doesn't work Woke up late yesterday morning because the alarm never went off. Same thing this morning, luckily I set a backup. Used to work great. Now it's literally worthless.
5,Appman Great now i can have as many reminders as i like . And choose any sound file too . .. I dont like android calender plus i can never hear it bleep.
5,River Patrol-HTC Explorer It is just great app! I was looking for something simple, effective and reliable. Also, I wanted to get rid of vibration mode (HTC wonÅLt allow yout o do so), plus listening to my fav song to get up full mood. Tried a couple of others, but I stick to this one...thumbs up!
5,Love it Best alarm clock I've tried yet. Haven't had it fail, and love the little options like "show next alarm text in lockscreen"
5,Simple and great! Many functions, but easy! Really "better alarm clock" of all in ... Simple and great! Many functions, but easy! Really "better alarm clock" of all in market! 5+
5,I really like this exie! This Alarm Klock offers the best features, IMHO: simple, intuitive, high customization. DIY'ers c'mon! ~:sDs:~ CM7DX
5,Simple and effective Does what it says. Please keep it lean-and-mean.
2,Sadly, 2-stars for not waking me up... Excellent app except for one catastrophic bug, sometimes when you press snooze it moves the alarm time up 24-hours instead of 5-minutes, seems to work correctly most of the time but randomly won't reactivate the alarm (leaving you oversleeping.)
5,The best alarm period! I have had this for many phones and years. It's the only one that doesn't crash or is buggy. Should be number one app of it s kind.
5,Best Alarm clock app been using it for a year without fail
3,Great, but has recently started to force close in landscape mode. Uninstalling :./
4,Loved it,but... I have been using yhis for almost 2 years,but since yesterday the snooze function has stopped working!please fix it!
1,Good Doesn't work on new Rezound ICS update. Can't choose sounds for alarm
1,Wow, the sound on this is terrible. It's so quiet that it did not ... Wow, the sound on this is terrible. It's so quiet that it did not wake me up and i was late for work. Uninstalling.

5,Just got a replacement Droid and searched for this exact Alarm again. Works great, ... Just got a replacement Droid and searched for this exact Alarm again. Works great, easy to figure out, and no ads. Love it!
5,Have been using it for a few days. Reliable so far. Yes it is ... Have been using it for a few days. Reliable so far. Yes it is barebone, but it does just what it should.
5,Love it Been using it as my ONLY alarm clock. Never had any problems.
5,BEST alarm out there I tried them all. Only request would be that the time-of-alarm setting be a wheel you spin, like other alarms, rather than the Klock's +/- system. But thank you for a fabulous app.
5,Slide to Dismiss! I love the slide to dismiss. It is to easy to tap dismiss in most alarm clocks.
4,Needs a timer Very nice alarm, but needs to a way to set off the alarm after a specific amount of time, say 45min, from the current time.
1,Motorola Droid 4 Had this program on prev phone (moto d2global)& it worked great. I got a new phone and put it on here but found that if I used the phone for anything at all (text,call,email) during the snooze interval the alarm would not sound again. This is a big issue as I often will snooze x1 make a phone call or text to a coworker and then go back to sleep and then when alarm fails to go off again I end up oversleeping. Contacted developer several months ago no response, still not fixed. Now uninstalling.
1,Snooze is broken on RAZR M. Sometimes the snooze will reset instead of snooze and the alarm won't fire until the next day.
5,Small, meet the purpose,thx. Change time through keypad doesn't work though!fix ... Small, meet the purpose,thx. Change time through keypad doesn't work though!fix or remove it! Pse make the Label, when pop up,bigger for easy reading.
5,Been months! Since the last review and still running with no hiccups! One option that would be great but not necessary is being able to copy the alarm as I usually set multiple times in one day. Either way, can't live without this app!
3,disregards number input nice concept, but seems to let you use keypad to change time settings then disregards what you've typed!
5,Good app! This does everything I want an alarm clock to do and doesn't take up a whole lot of space.
5,Simple light and effective All you need in an alarm clock. No fluff. Fantastic!
3,Please fix Does not work on s4,does not show screen,need to unlock it,also when you snooze it just cancels alarm,so it doesn't go off again and your late,please fix,worked amazing on my s3
5,even improves 4.0 got a new Android so functions of many of the apps I used to need are now standard features but the fade in feature of this alarm app isn't. love it!
5,Great app. Reset my phone and its one of the first apps I reinstalled.
4,Very good, but... It seems that "Snooze" is not working on JB 4.1.1.
5,This alarm rocks. Had it for a year and has never failed on me. ... This alarm rocks. Had it for a year and has never failed on me. Way better than the one galaxy comes with.
5,Since I removed clock widget It's a great way to add an alarm
5,Great App! So simple and just what I needed. Other alarms made me oversleep because they were too complicated.
5,Works great. I like that you can pick the volume and the music you ... Works great. I like that you can pick the volume and the music you want to wake up to. You haters must sleep through every alarm clock if this doesn't
1,Ok Doesn't work when phone is on silent as discovered this morning. Please fix
5,Why can't the stock alarms be like this? I love this alarm clock: it does exactly what I want. I l really like the slide to dismiss feature.
2,Nope Worked okay at first. Now lots of force closes, and the volume adjustment won't work at all.
1,Snooze still doesn't work on my galaxy s3 I have been late to work with an empty stomach twice now. Shame because it's a lovely app.
5,Simple, wakes me up, 'nuff said.
5,Love it! Simple to use & easy to set. I love that the snooze button is so big. I dont have to spend more than a few seconds to set it. It gives several options for text on the lock screen Only problem I had was with the Star Trek Go Locker theme, but the developer is fixing that pronto.
4,Simple Simple and effective alarm app that works. I like if for the lack of data mining like permissions.
5,Dan So simple and effective like taking a nice clean dump and only needing one piece of toilet paper to wipe off all the sponge left behind after squeezing one's anus organs. Highly Sean!!
2,Doesn't work on Galaxy S3 When you hit snooze, it cancels the alarm.
5,The best! I searched through so many alarm apps and this is what I ... The best! I searched through so many alarm apps and this is what I wanted all along! I like how it doesn't use the screensaver and instead runs like the built in alarm. I also really like how it has the ability to use all the default sounds rather than just the alarm-designated ones.
4,got this because the default android alarm only sounds for a few seconds and ... got this because the default android alarm only sounds for a few seconds and then stops and I wanted to play a whole mp3 great app thanks!

5,... I need a LOT of alarms to get up in the AM...this does the trick perfectly
4,Problem with snooze I've been using this app for a long time.. but now on my new phone - JB - I am also having problems with snooze button. Please fix because I love this app and has never failed me.
5,Best alarm clock Used this for over a year, tried others, but none as good as this
5,Simple and no-nonsense I found this app while looking for something which was less than 1 mb in size, since I am running out of phone memory. (This has replaced Alarm Clock Xtreme Free) I love this app - no maths problems, or slowly increasing volume, or all that palaver. It does exactly what I want, without too much unnecessary detail. And what's more important, it works,
2,Needs update Upgraded to android 4.3 and all my alarms were reset. On top of that, my new alarm tone is some horrible loudness and the app won't let me change it. Been using this app for a long time now and would like to continue to do so.
4,Nice app w/ custom sounds. Alarm label text is microscopic. Why no text size ... Nice app w/ custom sounds. Alarm label text is microscopic. Why no text size fix in this uodate? Make text bigger, get 5 stars. No probs on Epic.
4,Great But l run 24 Hr schedules with hourly events. This needs more than 6 alarms per day. Otherwise great.
5,Perfect Very simple to interpret, even with groggy morning mind. Best selwyn app on the market.
5,Best alarm ever! Always works great and there are so many personalization options! ... Best alarm ever! Always works great and there are so many personalization options! Love it!
5,I like it Nice features, volume adjust, mp3 alarms, snooze time set, multiple alarms, been using it for few months now.
2,Alarm use to override my locked screen when going off in the morning. Now ... Alarm use to override my locked screen when going off in the morning. Now I gotta unlock and then disarm the alarm.
1,I wanted it to work But it kept crashing on my Samsung on And 2.2.
3,I wish this app had fewer bugs The app is great when it works, but I had a couple of instances where a set alarm didn't go off, and it seems to just randomly choose what the alarm sound should be, ignoring my selection.
5,Perfect app Setting multiple alarms with different tones is great. app is simple and has all you need.
1,O Snooze doesn't work, fix that
5,Perfect Simple but most reliable for any time wake up.
5,I love it. My one request would be that the notification only appears for non-recurring alarms. Maybe an option to have it appear for recurring alarms in the next N hours, too. Mostly I don't need the notification for alarms that are six days, 23 hours away... But the app is awesome.
5,Nice enhancements Love the ability to adjust snooze duration and have alarm tone rise in volume over a length of time. Thanks!
4,Easy, efficient The only issue (?) is the Volume increase function: I never know how much strong it's gonna ring, it's try and see...-_-
5,Simple, works, no permissions Used this app for 2 years. Simple, no frills, and it works. Best of all, it requires no special permissions to run (no sneaky stuff here).
5,I've used Alarm Klock for a year. Much better than the built in alarm!
5,Small, Simple and yet good enough to get the job done!
5,Great functionality! Love this! I can set lots of alarms and label each one.
5,Best free alarm clock out there! Super easy to use and I can set ... Best free alarm clock out there! Super easy to use and I can set multiple alarms which can be activated or deactivated in seconds.

5,Requesting a Widget I love the variety of the alarm tones, but maybe a cool looking widget for my home screen? Pretty please?
5,Simple and good Love this alarm clock. My favorite is the slowly increasing volume so as not to shock me awake in the morning.
5,awesome alarm clock Has never failed me... love it!
5,My standby This has replaced my old desktop clockradio! I used to be a notorious oversleeper and actually own two alarms which I would set for about 15 minutes apart. Now I set two entries 10 mins apart in this app, with different snooze values, and the sort of randomness works well to get me out of bed.
1,Snooze button no longer reliable I've been using this for over a year until I updated to Jellybean and the Snooze button is no longer reliable. It may snooze or it may reset till the next alarm schedule. Please fix this! Otherise simple controls, easy to use with BIG snooze button.
3,Phone update has changed it. After using this for years I am moving over to alarm clock extreme due to this app no longer unlocking the phone when the alarm goes off. Dev sems to have given up on this app and so have I. Shame.

3,Used to be my favorite alarm app This was, HANDS DOWN, the best alarm app I had found. I'm a deep sleeper and most alarms just end up becoming part of my dream. I could always count on this alarm. I'm so sad it doesn't work the same with my nexus 4 as I did with my nexus s :( the tone I would normally use is not an option and it repeats even though I dont have the day selected. It also shuts off even though I only press snooze. I'm so sad that I can no longer use this app. It took forever to find it and now I'll have to look for another 1

5,Abs
2,Obnoxiously loud, can't be turned down I tried AK in order to wake up to an MP3. For that, it worked, but for some reason this app plays sounds at about one thousand times the volume I would want it to play at. That was okay for MP3s, because I could turn down the volume to 1% (yes, literally), which at that point was only a little bit too loud. But my MP3s change often, and if I forget to update AK to a new song, which happened a lot, then it would default to its incredibly annoying default sound, and play it at a thousand times the volume I desire. Unable to get it to wake me up at a reasonable volume, day after day, I have stopped using AK. Some people might need volume equal to a launching space shuttle in order to wake up, and for those people AK will probably be awesome. For me, though, I'm looking for something no louder than a machine gun at point-blank range.
