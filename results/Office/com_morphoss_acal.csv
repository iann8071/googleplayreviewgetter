5,Very fast (at least on my Note II) I really liked this app when I first tried it, but had to stop using it due to slow speeds (Galaxy S - various ROM versions). It worked OK, but took forever to load which made it sort of useless. I've upgraded to a Note II now, and it works great. Nearly instant load, opens tasks even faster, and added a new task entry quickly and easily. My only gripe is the widget seems not to want to work... And theres no widget for tasks.
5,Awesome client that works with my CalDav Works perfect with my CalDav server. Only client that I use with my personal server. Works good with GB, Ice Cream Sandwich and Jelly Bean. Can't wait for a tablet version. Definitely worth the buy.
3,Only client I use This is the only calendar client I use. Still beta - but works OK - seems to have problems with my Xoom screen layout but works fine and does not require a specific calendar service organization).
5,Excellent Works very well with my own Davical installation. Samsung Galaxy Note 2
1,Doesn't work Can't connect to Famjama. Emailed company for help in configuration, no reply. Waste of money!
1,Fruux sync Althoug documentation lists fruux as a supported server I couldn't make it work with that.
4,Gets My Yahoo Calendar and Yahoo "To Dos" On Phone I just downloaded this app on my HTC Rezound last night. It gets my Yahoo calendar on to the phone in a nice, manageable format with daily, weekly, monthly and yearly options. With regard to TASKS ("To Dos"), this is the only app I have found that can get my Yahoo To Do list on to the phone. That alone is enough to give the app four stars. The reason I don't give the app 5 stars is that my To Do list appears in one long alphabetical list rather than sorted in to categories like I have it on my computer. Nonetheless, the To Dos are color coded according to my categories. If I can find a way to sort the To Do list according to my categories, not just color code it to categories, I will update this review.
4,Caldav works with Google apps! This let me bypass the corporate device policy. Psyched.
4,Syncs Tasks using CalDav This is the only app I could find which synced my Samsung Galaxy Note II to do lists with my Ubuntu desktop via CalDAV. So now I've got Calendar, Tasks and Contacts all synced with my desktop (the latter via CardDAV, Fruux and Kontact). It works and it's ugly, but guess what? I prefer a working app to a beautiful app. It all works automatically and within seconds an entry on one device is transferred to the other.
2,Very slow Which is a shame as otherwise very good
1,Keeps crashing and doesn't connect
5,Glad it does NOT talk to Google I use this App so my business schedule is not shared with Google, please ignore those who ask for syncing with Google's Android calendar. P.S. Thanks for quickly fixing that FC in 1.32, the repeated FC pop-ups while doing other things were getting annoying in no time flat.
2,Didn't work for me Could not connect to my caldav server at work running icalserver over ssl. Unknown error null - I suspect the app isn't recognising the certificate.
3,Might be usefull, but does not work with memotoo
2,To buggy Really nice, but it keep on forgetting settings and it take a lot of time to load the calendars.
1,Doesn't work with my Desire Z and Oracle Beehive, despite both being listed as ... Doesn't work with my Desire Z and Oracle Beehive, despite both being listed as tested
5,Works fantastically with Bedework This app works wonderfully with the Bedework personal calendar server. Easy to use and nice features. Some things I'd like to see: simple agenda view (a simple list of upcoming events), and a widget for the home screen showing the next event in the calendar (like some of the other apps have).
5,This is the only app I could find for my X10 Mini Pro which ... This is the only app I could find for my X10 Mini Pro which will sync wirelessly with the mobileme caldav server. It works well, easy to set up.
3,I take back my 1 star and give 4 Works on LG Optimus One. Beware that syncing is a bit weird - it wont update as you'll get connected on the internet and there is no manual sync option. Otherwise works with Zimbra, notification are great. Would be a 5 star if manual 'sync now' option would be available and calendar canvas & buttons would be more native
2,May be a great app for all I know, sadly doesn't seen to work ... May be a great app for all I know, sadly doesn't seen to work with yahoo's caldav server so impossible to tell...
1,Does not integrate with native android calendar
5,The only calendar that support caldav, and it does it very well !
1,Won't recognize egroupware groupdav server. No online help.
4,This app works for me with davical, but only after upgrade to latest davical ... This app works for me with davical, but only after upgrade to latest davical version. Many tnx to developer for prompt support
5,Excellent software and support for the price Had issues getting this to work as still on 2.2 of Android. Received excellent help and support from the developer... now all working. aCal works well, is about the only client that supports CalDav Tasks/todos. It could do with a few tweaks, but for the price it is really useful, and as I said before - faultless support!
