4,Great app under rapid development Like lots of others I've been looking for a permanent solution since Astrid abruptly shut down, I've tried several but none have really gelled. Mirakel is great and improving quickly. Looking forward to task warrior sync stabilising.
4,Powerful and Organized This is better than Astrid. (I can't believe I'm still not over that app.) My favorite feature is the special lists; it allowed the user to make lists based on specific user-defined conditions. Also, it's open-source on GitHub.
5,Much better than Keep This is wonderful. I have been using it for a while and I can say that with a widget, it becomes very powerful.
4,Could replace astrid... Real potential here. I can't get the taskwarrior sync to work yet though....
5,Awesome. No ads. Code is public. Has a good widget. Is clean and lean. I want to pay, go pro. You're worth it.
5,Open source TODO-LIST app
5,The dev is too fast & created a amazing app There were some bugs but the dev is too fast to debug them & in just one day. As I start using this app, I am falling in love with it, more & more everytime. No stupid adds, and Now five stars because the dev truly deserves it. Recommended.
5,Great app, look forward to more.
5,The ToDo App This is how you develop a useful ToDo application for mobile devices, period.
5,Great ToDo List App!!! Exactly the ToDo list app i've been looking for years! Why can't be every app so simple and user-friendly?
5,Could not sync Using caldav with owncloud. Error says requires https. I am using ssl but I think I must be entering the url wrong. For owncloud it is something like: https://your.owncloud.site/remote.php/caldav/ how do I enter this in your app? I'll give five stars as it is probably my fault.
