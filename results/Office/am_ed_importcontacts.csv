1,Doesn't work Exported my contacts on my Mac into a .vcf file, copied to my phone's SD card, ran the import - all that came across were the names, none of the numbers or email addresses. Waste of time, and money. I want a refund!
1,Please fix Importing names and number but separating them. So when the import process finished, I have numbers without name and name without numbers.
5,Works on Android Tablet The old version didn't work with the vCard folder I created. The developer corrected the problem after being contacted. If you have a problem, let the developer know (as he requests) and he'll work to fix it. What a concept!
1,Doesn't work on One X + Can import the phonenumbers but not the names.
