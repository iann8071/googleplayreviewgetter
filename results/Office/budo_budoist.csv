4,Very Useful Been using for a year or so. Got a few quirks but after learn those very useful.
5,Best Todoist Android App Minimalist design and features make this better than new Todoist officialbapp.
5,The best This is much better than the official todoist app. Highly recommended.
5,Great This is the best todoist app. Tried the others and this one is the best. Good features. Please create a widget similar to gtasks
1,Useless
1,No preview Have to register before I see anything, interface is so minimal that i can't be bothered.
4,Better than the official app. It has a few bugs like with recurring tasks that get stuck or checked tasks unchecking by themselves, but it works much better than the official app.
4,Best app yet for todoist Simple and nice gui .
5,Simple but effective Simple but effective. I tested a lot, for me th best app available for todoist. Very helpful is the option to setup your own query.
4,Room for small improvement but great! Little buggy but seems to be constantly improving with each update. Still by far the best Todoist app available!
4,Very good work Very good work. When I have no sub projects I still have the arrow space holder empty and taking space affecting the good look oh GUI. Also the synching process takes long time. But it the best todoist client in my opinion
4,currently best Todoist app out there Great app, works well overall - much better than the one from Todoist! There are a couple bugs still, but not enough to make me give up on the app now, though. The two that bother me most are 1) sync - changes don't sync automatically, or even within the set amount of time (i.e., 30 minutes after making a change on my phone and it isn't showing on the Todoist web site, even though I have Budoist set to sync every 5 minutes) and it doesn't sync on start/exit even though I have it set to do so; and 2) date/time - when I enter a deadline with a time it never shows up correctly - if I set something for noon on 7/30, it shows up as (example) 11:30 PM on 8/3 on my phone, and maybe 3:00 AM on 7/30/2013 on the website. Then I edit the event on my phone, re-entering the correct date/time (which are showing correctly in the editing box, just not after the edits are submitted) and I'll end up with the event showing on my phone & the website at two different, but equally bizarre and incorrect, times. I've gotten in the habit of just writing out the full date/time in the text of the task, but that's not really a useful work-around long term.
5,Needs some work; not as good as typing todoist into browser This app is almost there, and I appreciate their efforts. With a few more updates, I think it will be stellar. Issues right now include: The changes you make don't sync right away. The shortcuts that todoist provides don't really work such as dates. For some reason, I can't find a way to just bring up today's tasks (please correct me if I'm wrong) Update 8/8: excellent updates and looks awesome on Samsung galaxy s3
5,Excellent - but Widget needed please Great looking & does what it says really well....but needs a Widget please.
5,Best todoist client for android Little more to say, simple and powerful, like todoist itself. Really good support and response from the developer.
5,Sweet! Best Todoist app. Tried all the rest, been using Todoist Pro, but this one is even better. Change the icon though.
5,Very Good Works fine. Very clean and tight. No issue here.
4,Best of free todoist apps so far I tried TodoToday, Todoist by lightful, & Todoist for Android before this one. This has most complete functionality. I hope I find no bugs.
5,This is the one Tried last (because i didnt like the app icon :-)), but budoist killed it! Free, fully functional (labels, query, priority, etc), and no ads, yes please and thank you!
5,Best app The best app for Todoist, and free!
