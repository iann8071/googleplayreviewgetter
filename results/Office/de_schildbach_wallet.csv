5,Great App
1,It was a great app... Bad app now because you took disconect option away..every time the wifi is turned on it drains the battery even tho you are not using the program!!
4,. .
3,Can't disconnect. Why did you remove the option to disconnect? I only keep this app running when I need it, and now I can't close it anymore.
2,Can't disconnect I can no longer disconnect. Please fix this. Otherwise fine.
4,Very Good But... Very simple and intuitive wallet app. More advanced features such as being able to customise the denomination displayed (microbitcoins, with the name set as "bits" as some people are advocating for example). And public notes/messages with transactions would be nice.
4,Works very well! Mostly! Works as it should, but once you start getting a bunch of transactions in there (15+) the app starts slowing down. Need to reset and download block chain info again when you have 30+? No, the app didn't hang, just be prepared to wait a good while.
5,Responsive developer I was concerned about the recent removal of the disconnect option from the menu. Not to worry! The app will intelligently disconnect by itself. The disconnect option only stored the current connections and it would have checked in automatically in a few minutes, so it really wasn't an "off" button anyway. Many thanks to the developer who patiently responded to my many questions.
5,It works nao Yay
5,Can't Send Coins Finally got it to work! User error.
2,Not as good as it was. Please please bring back the "disconnect" option.
5,Perfect
5,Hey mom send me bitcoins! Thank you for any kind of donation! 1PrPXUY4MQZvRYAdfseuqGFvSgpFtvrbJC Chive on!
5,Quick and well-designed The app is well-designed, easy to use (for a Bitcoin app), and is always responsive. Nice work!
1,Background resources usage! Catches up with the block chain on the background without any user control over it. Wastes data unless system-limited not to consume data on background (not available on older OS versions or on WiFi). Wastes battery (just reported it to waste 19% of it). The dev actively rejects this being an issue (see the replies on other comments).
5,Excellent wallet Quickly updated and easy to use. Works perfectly!
4,Nice app Would be great if one could include a public note (block chain) when sending a transaction
4,Design Easy-to-read layout!
1,What's happened to Disconnect option? Bugger this app eats resources now.. Disconnect was useful!
2,Battery drain Agree the network usage is low (although I'd still prefer an option to turn off background updating), but a lot of wakelocks, leading to increased battery drain. Will need to uninstall until this is fixed.
