3,Widget problems Okay, I love Coinbase, but this it getting frustrating. I used to be able to have my Coinbase widget update perfectly fine and have no problems checking my account. Now though even if I check the box that states, "keep this device authorized for 30 days" the widget requires me to login every day! Also, where the transactions used to show up: pending or complete in green and orange bubble boxes, now all that shows up is "unknown". This had been like this for over a week now.
4,Great app, easy to use But I don't understand why transactions stay pending confirmation for so long? I also use Blockchain and only takes a few minutes. Would also like to see in-app notifications.
5,Great App Not much to say, works great. Practical and easy to use.
4,Bugs! *Edit: it works quite well now!* Buy/Sell doesn't work. That's rather important. It kind of screwed me because I was no where near a PC when I tried to purchase some BTC for a friend. Had to delay the transaction for the weekend.
4,Glitches but good Nice overall but current update messed up the text layout of the send button.
5,Smoooth Very smooth, VERY good looking, very nice overall!
5,Hey mom send me bitcoins! 1PrPXUY4MQZvRYAdfseuqGFvSgpFtvrbJC Help out a poor college student. Any donation is greatly appreciated. Thank you and Chive on!
1,Don't use coinbase High chance of them not acknowledging your order when you buy before a price spike. Don't use this scam company. Use a real exchange where you buy n sell. Coinbase caused me to lose a lot of money I could have made if I chose a real exchange. Don't make the mistake I did.
4,New Update The new update fixed all the previous issues I had. Keep up the good work.
4,Much better! Latest update appears to have fixed the issues with Buy/Sell toggling. I love the convenience of the app. Would like to have multiple limit order functionality built in. I currently use Coinbase Trader to place limit/trailing limit orders.
5,Can't sell bitcoins (fixed!) The selection to change buy bitcoins to sell bitcoins cannot be changed, looks like some UI bug. Update: Fixed in latest version
5,Works flawlessly Earlier I was having a verification issue that I resolved using an Authy code. Since, I've conducted transactions through this app and I'm happy to report it works perfectly. I highly recommend installing this very useful tool. If you're into BTC and are a Coinbase customer, this Android app is a must.
4,The latest version is much improved. The app design is pretty straightforward. Does what it's supposed to.
4,Better. App needs to show all 8 placed. Every time I start app on different device, have to set options for 4 digit code still.
3,Kicking me off The newest version of the app kicks me off after about 6 hours or so, even when I check the boxes to remember my info, it doesn't. 5 stars for fix.
4,Good app overall Takes a while for transactions to go through. Buying and selling is easy.
4,Fixed Concur with 2013-10 reviews of v1.1.1, Buy/Sell page is broken. Buy can not be changed to Sell. If you dismiss the numeric keyboard you can't bring it back up. Droid Maxx Android 4.2.2. ** UPDATE ** 2013-12-30 update looks to have fixed everything.
3,Getting Better Like the app so far. Would really like to be able to import from a paper wallet, though.
2,Meh Coinbase is ok for buying btc. But not storing. Use Mycelium if you're serious. This app is quite buggy. Sometimes delays transactions.
5,UI is great Tough to find an application that follows the Android design guidelines when it comes to the sliding drawer navigation. Great job.
