5,Best little note app ever! I've used many note apps. This is by far my favorite. Only thing I would add-a way to stack/merge like notes together.
4,Transparency Option Please Quick response and convenient. Thank you for this good app. If an option to set the note into half transparent be added so that it won't wholly obstruct the background, this app will be perfect.
5,This app is already perfect as it is! Definitely the kind of app that I'm looking for. My setup: Floating stickies + Floating Toucher or Toucher Pro, for easier access to app. For those who complaining, if this app is not working the way you think it should, then this app is NOT for you. Instead of rating this app down, go find tons of other apps that is probably more suitable for you such as; Hovernote, float window notepad or PortalWindow. Bravo to developer for offering this app for free.
4,Not quite there... This app would be ideal if one could open a new note by clicking on a shortcut to the app. As it stands, if one has any active notes minimized to the margin, clicking on the app shortcut has no effect (i.e., nothing happens). I would like the effect of clicking on the app shortcut to always result in the creation of a new note. Btw, I like having immediate access to minimized notes regardless of which screen/app I am currently in.
4,Very handy One major flaw... It is too easy to accidentally delete your note. It would be nice if there were a warning like: are you sure you want to delete this note?
1,Very bad application! Crashes my phone I was trying to use it but it always crashed while moving the notes! Please fix! Furtmore it totally drained my battery after time. I'm using now BortherMe Sticky note, which is easier to use and it also helps to be reminded of things! I don't forget anymore.
2,How do you make it transparent? Good idea, but latest update says you can make notes transparent, so how do you do it and what does "when the screen is unfocused" mean? No way to email developer.
4,Very good For what it's made for, it makes it's job very well. Though it'd be nice if I could copy and paste text the natural way and not via some menu... Also, it's very easy to just close a window and not be warned. Maybe it's also possible to make some sleek, light grey style like in google keep? Those are just requests, the app itself is awesome and helped me many times!
2,Love it except Love it way better than any other I've found on Play, however.. It's VERY annoying when you slide to the edge and get the pencil. The pencil is awesome, but it Overlays EVERY app you open. Needs to stay on home screens only. Change that and it'll be a 5 star app easy.. :) UPDATE: Needs to be converted to a widget.. It's getting really annoying now and also uses up lot of battery and CPU...
3,Cool. But one thing... Very useful for on the go things you must keep in mind. One issue: it should close completely when you click to close (either all X's or by clicking the alert). Instead, the notes close, the alert goes away... but the process and service keep running. Have to manually kill to get rid of it, every time. Please make it truly close.
5,Woo!! *sniffles* lol thank you!! I have severe ADD, this is perfect! Many thanks to both you and Appgratis! :D
5,Nice and able to be in phone.. Floating stickies played a very important role in completing my work...... When it disappears on side then it become more adorable.
3,Simple and Effective Love the concept of this app... I just wish it had more customization. I'd like to see the ability to change font size to whatever size you choose and to allow you to choose your own font. Another fun option would be the ability to draw: choosing your own pen color and pen size. Also, I'd like to be able to choose the color of my note instead of it being randomly given to me and it should allow the option to dock your notes anywhere on your screen. There's so many places that this app could go!
5,Best App ever Nothing to say just 5 stars :) Its good for noting down urgent numbers Temporary notes for fb status updates You can do little more improvements like support of copy/pasting pics More smaller size of note But overall it's a perfect must having app
5,Perfect Sticky Notes for Samsung Galaxy Note 8 This is the best Sticky Notes I ever evaluate. The floating notes features is very important in this case. Thanks guys. You are awesome.
5,Excellent App I've been looking for such app for a long time and finally found it, thanks alot Mohammad... ((????? ))
4,2 Improvements would make this a 5-star rating 1. Please add a little ? icon or something that links to the info about how to resize, close, dock, etc that first appears when you open the app. I was overwhelmed with all the actions it said I could do and when it came down to actually doing those things, I had already forgotten how. Now I can't find it again. 2. Please add a "Are you sure you want to delete this?" with a Yes/No option when you select the little X icon. I've deleted an extensive and important forget-me-not list unintentionally that way. My son deleted the replacement note. I'd really, really, really want a way to avoid that happening again. Thanks!
5,Wish I Found this Sooner! I was needing something exactly like this app yesterday. I wish I found this great app sooner!
4,Nice Tool! Can increase the font size? Looking too small on my Note 2.
5,Superb Superb!! It really help me taking notes for my paper. Usually i write the blue print of my paper on it, then share it to my computer. Also i can take some notes from many resources: e-book or Internet while the sticky notes will always appear on my opened screen. I combine this sticky notes with sidebar lite . ... Thank you Mohammad Adib :)
4,見ながらメモ 邪魔な時は左辺でアイコン。透過の挙動は謎。フォーカス云々は関係なくキーボードの裏に移動させてキーボードが消えると透過になるが、リサイズやアイコン化等するまで透過したまま・・・。常用しない使用でもスタートアップするのは改悪。一般のタスクキラーでは殺せないサービスプロセスが常駐する。froyo
2,便利ですが 電源ON時にいちいち起動しなくてはいけないのが不便です。
5,すごく使える コピペができない時など何かと役に立ちます。アプリを終了したあとも20MBくらいメモリに常駐するのでどうかと思いましたが、数分で実行中から消えました。とても良いアプリだと思います。
4,(･∩･)ｼｮﾎﾞﾝ･･･ 使いやすい！のに チョッと残念、電源OFFになるとペンマークが消えちゃう
4,概ね良好 右側にも格納したい。
5,Great app This app is a masterpiece. I've been looking for a memo like this! Thanks for your genius.
