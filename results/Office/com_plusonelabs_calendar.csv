4,Good but could use small additions This widget is clean and smooth. It could benefit from changing the font to something like to the Roboto Condensed family for easier reading. Also, the ability to choose the alignment of the date to the left (right aligned is only option by default) would be very nice. Great job so far!!!
5,Good looking and easy to use.
5,Finally more color options... Finally got options to change calendar text colors.
4,Nice I think it could use a few interface tweaks, but it is the nicest calendar widget that I have found so far. I am not crazy about how the header is set up outside of the widget box.
5,It simply works After trying countless calendar widgets I've found this little cutie. It's got enough configuration options to please the picky ones and yet remains simple and uncluttered. I just love it and rely on it for my daily activities. A must have.
5,Great! Love the transparent look on my homescreen! Any way of adding sync with any.do??
5,Amazing! Awesome calendar widget, exactly what I was looking for so long. Congrats!
4,Perfect after immediately fixed. Great developer always listens to what users concern, and make it better. Thank you for the last update, now it's perfect on my home screen!
1,Won't open. I tried to uninstall it and reinstall it and it still won't open.
4,Smooth and good looking but with one flaw The flaw is that which calendars to show for the widget is global, meaning if you want multiple instances of the widget you can't have them display separate calendars. They will be identical. But for a single widget it works great.
5,First impression: great!
5,Very nice Must have!
5,beautiful & functional thank you
4,Excellent Could add some extra fonts though :)
5,Nice update Love it. Very nice.
2,Updated, then endless crash. I very like it before, waiting for fix.
5,Best calendar widget! But... Week days names too long: "Wednesday" could be contracted just to "Wed". The transparency feature is what made me give a high score to this widget because I use beautiful live wallpapers. Keep it up!
5,Great calendar widget
5,Excellent stuff Simple but complete
4,Missing events Sometimes can't show the last repeated event. Sony Xperia V@ AOKP 4.3
5,ウィジェットも良い 予定を作成しウィジェットでのスクロールで全て見れます。 。 日本語対応してるので設定も簡単です
5,シンプル 無駄に主張しすぎることもなくすばらしいウィジェットです。右上から予定の追加や設定の変更ができるのも魅力的。
