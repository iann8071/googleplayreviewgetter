5,best cal widget By far the best cal widget. Compact and efficient easy to read Would be perfect if you could choose the cal app to open when clicked
5,the best agenda widget I could find Looks very good, works good, and has a very high level of customisation such as widget size, opacity, font size and others. I would not mind paying for widget like this. But reading the reviews below, I wonder whether it will work when I upgrade to ICS and Sense 3.6. A bit of clarification from Anton would help.
5,Great App! Fantastic app but would like to be able to override calendar colours as Android is broken in this respect. I have two calendars that show black colour which is annoying and makes the widget look ugly.
5,GREAT WIDGET AN AGENDA WIDGET THAT DISPLAYS APOINTMENTS TAKING MINIMAL MEMORY. WOULD LIKE AN OPTION TO REMOVE LOCATION. THANKS!!!
5,Good widget Widget is good but they need to show up as a group and not 8 different widgets in my list
5,Love it Calendar works great. The only thing I might add would be the ability to change colors, other than that it's great
5,Great calendar widget!! Informative, attractive, flexible, and free - what more can one ask for? Danke!
4,Good display and options The selection of options is good but for 5 stars I would appreciate the ability to change the font color and also to have today's date displayed in the widget.
4,Good agenda calendar...LG L7/P700 ICS 4.0.3 Very good. Like option calendar or setting when I tap widget. Problem: Birthdays are checked in settings but it isn't displaying birthdays from phone or google calendar. For update: make widget size selectable. If I want only 4x1 to displey in settings for home screen/widges. Becouse it is using 3 screens of widgets to displey all sizes(2x1,3x1,3x2,3x3,4x1,4x2,4x3,4x4). Also scroll can be added if more lines are present.
4,Auto delete.. Very helpful widget, but should have option to auto delete after a few days for old events
5,Finally, simple, working, uncluttered, useful Just what I was looking for, Simply amazing. Works like a charm
5,5 stars, Thanks Anton Simple, informative, user friendly, stable, less battery consumtion, work fine in Samsung Galaxy S2 after upgrade to Jelly bean, would be great if can choose to open other calendar when clicked
5,The best I tried about ten of the top rated calendar Widgets and all others wasted space. This one allows maximum items to display clearly in minimum space and has very good logical customization. ***3/20/13 update*** just updated to Jelly Bean. Calendar widget no longer works. Hoping you will update soon!
4,One thing missing Would be nice to have today's date visible in there
5,Perfect For me the best calendar manager (i9100g/ICS)
1,Needs a highlight option Needs a highlight option for current day event. If that changes I will give 5 stars!
5,Working great so far On my jelly bean note 2
3,Good...but BIG but. I like it well enough, except it constantly sets my time zone to London, Dublin for scheduling alarms for events, no matter how many times I lock the time zone & reset it.
3,Anton's Calendar Widget Great app except for the fact when I add something to my calendar, it will not update on the widget screen until I click on the app and press settings...then it loads. Other than that I love it.
5,Super calendar Easy, nice...just love it.
5,シンプルで最高 メモリ容量を気にする機種にはベストアプリです。
5,ほんとにありがとう どの背景にもあい、でしゃばることなくほんとにいつも助かってます。 いいソフトを有り難う。 そしてこれからもよろしく。
4,背景とフォントの色、月日の表示方法 が変更できたらいいなあと思います。背景の形も角丸以外にも変更できればなおいいです！
