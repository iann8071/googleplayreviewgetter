5,best cal widget By far the best cal widget. Compact and efficient easy to read Would be perfect if you could choose the cal app to open when clicked
5,the best agenda widget I could find Looks very good, works good, and has a very high level of customisation such as widget size, opacity, font size and others. I would not mind paying for widget like this. But reading the reviews below, I wonder whether it will work when I upgrade to ICS and Sense 3.6. A bit of clarification from Anton would help.
5,Great App! Fantastic app but would like to be able to override calendar colours as Android is broken in this respect. I have two calendars that show black colour which is annoying and makes the widget look ugly.
5,GREAT WIDGET AN AGENDA WIDGET THAT DISPLAYS APOINTMENTS TAKING MINIMAL MEMORY. WOULD LIKE AN OPTION TO REMOVE LOCATION. THANKS!!!
5,Good widget Widget is good but they need to show up as a group and not 8 different widgets in my list
5,Love it Calendar works great. The only thing I might add would be the ability to change colors, other than that it's great
5,Great calendar widget!! Informative, attractive, flexible, and free - what more can one ask for? Danke!
4,Good display and options The selection of options is good but for 5 stars I would appreciate the ability to change the font color and also to have today's date displayed in the widget.
4,Good agenda calendar...LG L7/P700 ICS 4.0.3 Very good. Like option calendar or setting when I tap widget. Problem: Birthdays are checked in settings but it isn't displaying birthdays from phone or google calendar. For update: make widget size selectable. If I want only 4x1 to displey in settings for home screen/widges. Becouse it is using 3 screens of widgets to displey all sizes(2x1,3x1,3x2,3x3,4x1,4x2,4x3,4x4). Also scroll can be added if more lines are present.
4,Auto delete.. Very helpful widget, but should have option to auto delete after a few days for old events
5,Finally, simple, working, uncluttered, useful Just what I was looking for, Simply amazing. Works like a charm
5,5 stars, Thanks Anton Simple, informative, user friendly, stable, less battery consumtion, work fine in Samsung Galaxy S2 after upgrade to Jelly bean, would be great if can choose to open other calendar when clicked
5,The best I tried about ten of the top rated calendar Widgets and all others wasted space. This one allows maximum items to display clearly in minimum space and has very good logical customization. ***3/20/13 update*** just updated to Jelly Bean. Calendar widget no longer works. Hoping you will update soon!
4,One thing missing Would be nice to have today's date visible in there
5,Perfect For me the best calendar manager (i9100g/ICS)
1,Needs a highlight option Needs a highlight option for current day event. If that changes I will give 5 stars!
5,Working great so far On my jelly bean note 2
3,Good...but BIG but. I like it well enough, except it constantly sets my time zone to London, Dublin for scheduling alarms for events, no matter how many times I lock the time zone & reset it.
3,Anton's Calendar Widget Great app except for the fact when I add something to my calendar, it will not update on the widget screen until I click on the app and press settings...then it loads. Other than that I love it.
5,Super calendar Easy, nice...just love it.
4,Good simple clean calendar widget. As stated above. Looks clean on home screen. The only reason for a 4 instead of a 5 is because it lists all day events of the next day ahead of events of the current day with a start and end time.
5,So great it's stopping me updating to ICS! Sounds odd, doesn't it? But it's true; I like this widget so much I'm staying with GB as it won't work with ICS. I'd be quite happy to pay for an update to work on ICS. Go Anton!
4,Thank you Anton for the best calendar widget! Would like to see support for auto-open user defined calendar app on widget press. Support for aCalendar+ would be great.
4,Good with several widget sized Good, easy, simple. Supports widgets in different sizes. Only flaw is that it takes longer before it updates after adding new item to calendar. Should have a manual refresh option.
4,One of the best Only deal breaker was that it would not open any other calendar than s-planner. If it could open business calendar it would be the best widget in the store.
4,Simple&effective Simple with reasonble permissions. Option 2 override callendars colors (and event text) would be great - allows good visibility for event family...
5,DOES NOT WORK WITH ICS aarrgghh I updated to ICS, now I cant ur widget at all, pls pls hurry find a solution....
5,Clean effective organized All of the above. Works on ICS now! Hands down the best calendar widget on the Play Store.
3,Great I like the compactness ... However it looks like the widget updating is delayed ... I deleted an appointment ...but it remained in widget
4,No more update? Only one main problem...when synching new appointment...it do not show the new item until reboot. Also when clicking on the widget, it should go directly to calendar!
5,Wow!!! i like the c0ncept of such app...n0 need to go over to my calendar and view my schedule of activities of a particular day...nice job ANTON!
3,. Good, but please use bigger calendar color marks and more flexible date format!
4,Nice Would be nice to have the today's stuff highlighted. Make it a lil easier to see at a glance.
4,Practical but not "Android Design" It's android 2.3.x style.
5,Love it! No memory or battery drain. Simple and to the point! Thank you!
5,Best widget for forgetful minds 5 star worthy, on my nexus 7 and my android merge phone it does what it's supposed to do. I would have paid for this app and still been happy
5,Perfect for my need Thanks for a sharing this great app!!!!more apps please
5,great app. minimalist . exactly what I was looking for. thank you.
5,The best Good wig ive used
5,Excellent Outstanding calendar widget & open source!
5,Must have... Small in size! If possible, please shows colour to the event contents rather then a colour dot in front.
5,Awesome App Best widget out there. Its a shame its so far down the list. I've tried a lot of them searching for this one. Highly recommend.
1,Can't find it Tried installing it a few times. Does not seem to work on Samsung Galaxy SG4. Can't find the widget or application to install the widget anywhere. A pity as it looked like a nice application.
5,By far the best agenda widget I have no idea how many agenda widgets I've tried, and Anton's is the best. Flexible opacity settings allow it to blend to the rest of my home screen. Selecting which calendars show up is important, and the little color box helps see what is going on where. Great app!
4,Great but fails on ICS Had this app a long time on HTC Desire HD, was great, just what I wanted, but now I have the HTC One X with ICS and it doesn't work :-( bbbbbbooooo, hope it gets fixed
5,Perfect I wanted a simple widget that would display events and this one is perfect. Transparency background adjustment is much appreciated.
4,yessssss finally some one who gets it. with just the right kind and amount of options
3,Please update I loved this widget but now it don't work with ICS :'(
4,Very good size/quality ratio. Allow me to open another calendar than the built-in ... Very good size/quality ratio. Allow me to open another calendar than the built-in one from the widget and I'll give 5 stars....
4,Great Calendar What about 2x3 option, need width to see all details, but 2xhigh is max for home screen.
5,Perfect Just the type of calender I wanted. Thanks!
3,Is good but I need more option Thank SGS II
1,Aslam I downloaded this but doesn't show up on my widget list. I have HTC sensation. Please help.
5,Very good widget, thanks Anton! Font size option change is steep from 100 to ... Very good widget, thanks Anton! Font size option change is steep from 100 to 125%, how about 110%? Or bring in sliders for font size and opacity.
5,Finally! The perfect calendar agenda widget. Lists up to 25 upcoming ... Finally! The perfect calendar agenda widget. Lists up to 25 upcoming appointments. Just a list. No other mumbo jumbo. Just what i was looking for.
4,Nice I'd like to see more squared corners if possible.
5,Best calendar widget out there Simple & elegant. The way I like it.
4,Great It installed so fast i couldnt find it but it is neat
5,Simple so GREAT Sure, I might have added a few more things, but this really does everything I need. I fits what I was looking for and doesn't have any weird permissions. Thanks!
4,Great! One of the best calendars I've ever installed. Just missing option to change font color
1,Does not work on galaxy nexus.
4,Pretty good Overall its great. But newly created items don't appear on widget without restart
3,Has potential, but lacks option to set my own calendar app to open when ... Has potential, but lacks option to set my own calendar app to open when I tap the widget.
5,Got ICS update :-\ This is such a great app...i hope so much that it get fixed on ics *.*
5,Would pay! I love this widget! Almost exactly what I've spent hours searching for on Google Play. I would happily pay for a version with more customization options.
1,Doesn't work on G Nexus. Doesn't work on G Nexus.
5,Very space efficient! I've downloaded about 15 other free calendar widgets this week and this is definitely the best. The design is simple and clean. Thanks Anton!
5,LOVE This widget! Wish it was higher in the list so it was easier ... LOVE This widget! Wish it was higher in the list so it was easier to find. Had to try soo many others before finding this one. The BEST!!! Thanks!
5,Love it!! I keep coming back to this app, just never found one comparable. Thanks for the great app!
1,I have downloaded this a few times but theres something wrong as it wont ... I have downloaded this a few times but theres something wrong as it wont open for me. I am disappointed as.the app sounds very elegant.
5,Best agenda app out there HTC Merge
4,Compact Clean and unobtrusive. Small file size also.
5,Exact This is exactly what I've been looking for a long time; I've tried almost any another app with widget and they massively lack the look and beautiful simplicity of this widget. Would be better with a scroll option but you'll also need a launcher, right?
4,Anson Please add an option to change the widget font color. Otherwise ... 5 stars.
5,Awesome Great work. One option that would be nice to see would be the ability to hide the alarm icons. Thanks
5,Fantastic Perfect for me. Love the simplicity and elegance.
5,Useful It seems simple but this is only calendar widget that lets you fit a lot on the home screen.
2,. Was great, but no ICS. Sad face.
2,Doesn't work Galaxy nexus
4,Ollie1066 This is a great app except for one problem. I have it synchronizing with Outlook but it does not show recurring appointments. Please add that feature.
4,Best calendar widget I have found I'd love an option to be able to display the weekday name as well as the date for all events, not just the next 7 days. (e.g. W 12/5 2pm - 3pm) Also not sure how easy it is to implement, but being able to scroll to future events within the widget itself instead of having to go to the calendar app would be great.
5,greatest and simplest perfectly fits in home screen.
4,Like it Great widget, simple and effective
4,Great app but would like to see 1 widget icon with adjustable sizes.
5,Excellent widget Its does what it's supposed to - and very good at it. Reads all calendars, custom date string, nice options for customizing display of agenda. I use it with Widget Locker to display agenda on lock screen.
1,Suddenly stopped working Deleted appointments won't disappear even after full reinstall.
1,0 stars Won't even let me open on vortex!!!
5,So simple to configure and looks sooo good! Great job!
5,Finally. Thank you. It till me two days of searching to find exactly what I wanted. This is it.
5,Sweet Simple and looks good
5,: D Love it!
5,45ascend Great
4,Nice and simple
5,Super Fantastic !
5,Just what I needed!
5,Works like a charm
5,Nexus s Force close with ice cream sandwich
5,A Lovin' it
5,Super Like it :-)
5,Works well, get a lot of events in to a small space. Got rid ... Works well, get a lot of events in to a small space. Got rid of the HTC widget after using this.
5,super widget.. wenn man noch die startzeit von terminen ausblenden koennte waere es fuer mich perfekt..
5,Scrollable? It shows all full day events, but the top is last week, bottom is today. I would like to see: Today at the top Future events at the bottom Great app!
4,Just what I needed. 5 star when widget will be resizeable instead of different widged for each size. Galaxy S II
5,Would be great to be able to choose which calendar app to run on ... Would be great to be able to choose which calendar app to run on click, not just default one.
4,Needs option for other date formats Good widget - nice and clean. However need an option to have date formats other than month/day. Here in Australia as in other parts of the world we use day/month.
5,Max info in min space + customizable. Best cal app for homescreen.
1,Does not work on A70, see only grey box
2,Functional, and reasonable Google integration, however a lack of ... Functional, and reasonable Google integration, however a lack of configurability lets this down [Galaxy Tab]
5,Great, clean, easy to read widget which is what I needed.
3,It's good, very compact, but it NEEDS the date included at least weekly to ... It's good, very compact, but it NEEDS the date included at least weekly to avoid confusion. Maybe label every Monday?
5,Wonderful Exactly what I was looking for... Thank you!
5,Awesome - Ayomal Peiris Great widget. Simple and subtle. Highly recommended for Sony Xperia S.
2,Need fix It was one of the best widgets I ever used but stopped working since updated to ICS now always giving error on loading Plz fix
2,Forced shutdowns for Galaxy S2 It was an awesome app - its the only calander widget that had a 2x1 calendar. Unfortunately, it caused my phone to shut down randomly. Maybe they'll fix the bug in the future.
2,Would be nice I would like to use it but it doesn't work with aCalendar. Refreshs don't work after a day, and if you accidentally click on the 'Open Calendar' area which you can't get rid of the app crashes. Shame because this is one of the very few notification apps out there without phony internet permissions.
5,Shows multiple days Seems like most apps only show 1 day, or takes an entire screen, this shows multiple days on size of your choosing, very nice
5,Very helpful There is no other way to put it. My life has changed with this app. Its on of the few apos that dont have any problems
5,Just what I needed Love the size options and opacity options.
5,Great app Excellent app, can u make the widgets scrollable tho so we can scroll down to see more than just the first 5 events?
2,Pointless Needlessly cluttered, is really just a launcher for your calendar.
1,Ok Not to good because it stopped and freezes my phone
1,Use to be good..... .......But stopped working with new upgrade.
1,Sad Sad display, better Widgets available.
5,Excellent use of screen space
5,Best quick view Cal widget ever!
5,5/5 Perfect
5,シンプルで最高 メモリ容量を気にする機種にはベストアプリです。
5,ほんとにありがとう どの背景にもあい、でしゃばることなくほんとにいつも助かってます。 いいソフトを有り難う。 そしてこれからもよろしく。
4,背景とフォントの色、月日の表示方法 が変更できたらいいなあと思います。背景の形も角丸以外にも変更できればなおいいです！
