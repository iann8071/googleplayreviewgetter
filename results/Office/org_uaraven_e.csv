4,Please add more detail This app is really usefull, but I really wish it were more detailed.
1,E954 is banned in many countries and causes cancer but according to this app ... E954 is banned in many countries and causes cancer but according to this app is green and ok ...
3,interface is good, very uninformative the tool needs detailed description of the substances and its effects, not uninformative labels like "causes adhd".
4,Useful As a vegetarian I find this useful to check products
5,Informative
1,Innaccurate Unfortunatly the chart is inaccurate it lists polysorbate 80 and aspartame as an e suitable addictive for kids. Sadly very wrong. I'd use it as a guide only but not for solid proof.
1,Disappointing This app has many definitions that are incorrect such as marking aspartame as safe. I'll stick to my little handbook for now
2,Seems to putting a lot of additives to the 'safe' category, while other databases ... Seems to putting a lot of additives to the 'safe' category, while other databases are more strict. E250 for example.
3,Disappointing This shows the green leaf symbol for E910 which is incorrect, E910 is made from animal or human hair and/or chicken feathers, its definitely not vegetarian!
3,problem with lg p970 lg p970 couldnt show the actual name of the additives, guessing maybe because of the font colour?
5,Mayooma Very useful does not spy on you either unlike most free apps, could with improving the search though

5,Feature request Set default keyboard to numeric to speed up search.
5,Useful one
2,not userfriendly
4,Would like a vs where i can add personal info, eg I know 627 ... Would like a vs where i can add personal info, eg I know 627 is bad for my kids ( behaviour) yet it is shown as safe. Otherwise great.
5,Great! The app is really great and serves its purpose, as a vegan Im often finding myself in doubt, but no more. My only 'dislike' is the yellow color of the icons, its not always easy to take a quick look, as its somewhat hard to distinguish from the green, maybe an orange would do the job better. Either way,5 stars from here and a thank you for making our life easier
