5,Still the best! Despite no longer being updated this timer is, in my opinion, the very best on the Droid. Small file-size, multiple timers, configurable presets, no adverts, and total reliability. Only two things could improve this app really; support for landscape, and an updated user-interface as it does look a tad dated more. Hopefully one day the Dev will revisit this wonderful app and give us the update we desire.
5,Superb application As an amateur barbecue pitmaster I will simultaneously smoke several products. The triple timer is an excellent tool when combined with temperature probes. There are many expensive products. This is free and it DOES the job! Great application. Mine is programmed with a squealing pig alert sound to alert to end times.
5,Exactly what I needed. I love this app. It's just a simple app that is easy to use. I really appreciate having 3 different timers too. I've never had a problem with it. It's better then my actual kitchen timer that has been without batteries for a long time cuz it took a special tiny battery.
3,Vibe does not work on Nexus One 2.3. Also can't seem to play alarm ... Vibe does not work on Nexus One 2.3. Also can't seem to play alarm when in silent or vibe mode. Other alarm apps can do this. Nice UI.
3,Its ok. Time resets when alarm goes off. Can't start and stop. Doesn't track ... Its ok. Time resets when alarm goes off. Can't start and stop. Doesn't track time since alarm went off.
4,Simple and works Very simple app that does the job. The only thing I'd love to see updated would be adding a way to view the remaining time without going back into the app. It puts an item in the notification area that a timer is running, it would be great if this could also show how much time is remaining on the timers.
4,Well-designed and easy to use. This app delivers exactly what it says, plus a little: 3 timers with separate countdowns allow you to time staged processes without having to reset the timer, which is great for those "cook on medium-high heat for 20 minutes, then remove cover and allow to simmer on low for another 40 minutes" recipes.
5,Very useful, definitely recommend it No frills, simple, straightforward, and being able to have three timers going at once is extremely helpful :-)
5,The best ! As I get older I depend on timers, ( big time ! ). 5 stars and a beer!!! I've found this app. to be user friendly and dependable. Thanks for a good product.
5,Kitchen timer Lives u to it's name. About the cleanest and simplest timer app. I couldn't figure out how to delete a timer name, but that's me, not the app. May I encourage those who complain it doesn't have enough functions to look at their hands (there are only 2) and torso (1, only)? It's not likely that another function would help manage time better... Great kitchen timer, NOT lap timer.
5,GREAT Timer app… I used this app daily and never had a problem. But with my recent Android update, it is now redundant. If you didn't get the new update yet, download this app today! - - Samsung Nexus
1,Need a pause button It would be better if there is a pause button. So disappointed!
3,Not bad, but not great Its a good simple to use timer. But it is frustrating as far as options go. You can't change the tone.
4,Steve Works well enough except it misses out numbers at random! Couldn't believe it at first but have now checked several times.
5,Simple, effective Delivers. Excellent app. Unfortunately no tablet version, it would be perfect
5,Great timer! Love it! Simple yet satisfying... Easy to use. No problems at all with O.S.
4,Works well, but annoying tune This timer works really well, is easy to use, but I'm afraid the crowing cockerel noise is just too annoying, so it's has to go.
3,Good app I got a new phone, had to re- install this app to new phone and found out that the rooster alarm sound is no longer a choice for tones. Would have given a 5 star but really miss that alarm tone. Please bring back rooster tone as a choice.
5,Couldnt find it on playstore on my tablet and panicked I love this app- use it every day to time my lunch break. I'd be in big trouble without it. Allows me to relax and enjoy my lunch. But thats not all I use it for...I use it to time anything I need to time. It's great! I have put it on all of my phones for years. So I go to put it on my tablet- Galaxy Note 10.1, and I can't find it! I looked through more than 230 kitchen timers and it wasn't there. Finally looked on my phone for developer's name, and when I looked it up there were some other apps but no timer. I decided to make a donation just because I really appreciate this timer app, and lo and behold, after doing so I was able to find the app on playstore and download it. A miracle! Great! Love it! It works on my tablet. ?. It's just tiny- like phone size. That's okay by me...I got it and it works. Thanks a bunch!
1,時間ズレます。1時間50分に設定したのに2時間半後に鳴りました。 大事な仕事で使用して失敗しました。
4,良いです。 使いやすいし、今のところバックグラウンドでフリーズしたりする事もないので良いアプリだと思います。ポーズが出来ないのがいまいちかな。
5,使うと、ショートカットの文字が動きだします。①このアプリを使う②終了させる→ショートカットの１つ(何れがなるか分からない)のアプリ名 ... 使うと、ショートカットの文字が動きだします。①このアプリを使う②終了させる→ショートカットの１つ(何れがなるか分からない)のアプリ名が、右から左に流れて行きます。テレビのテロップみたいで面白いので、ちゃんとした形でこの機能も欲しいです。
5,必要権限が少ないのが良い 最低限の権限しか要求されないので安心感がある
4,IS03だと下が切れてしまう ｔｉｍｅｒ２とｔｉｍｅｒ３のボタンが切れてしまうIS03特有の画面構成だからだが、なんとかして欲しいところだ。
3,時間の入力が面倒。 celtonのChef's Kitchen Timer の方が良い。
1,スタートボタンありすぎ自重www
2,bad layout, so I can not touch 2nd and 3rd button.
5,アプリ名通り 単純だけど便利なアプリです。
3,カップラーメンが美味しく作れるようになりました。
