5,Nice little app, good people too Still loving this program. I can keep track of complicated lace patterns and all the repeats. With the new text section, I can note the pattern and not have refer back to my pattern. Works great on my new Nexus 7. I had a problem with the buttons on my Acer tablet running Honeycomb. I emailed the developer, he borrowed a tablet, saw my problem and fixed it! Love this program. Still love this program. Now also on my Samsung Galaxy S3.
4,Handy I wish it handled multiple simultaneous repeats a little better.
5,Brilliant The first knitting counter app I ever tried - and the only one I'll ever need! Really useful.
5,Fantastic app Absolutely love it - made tackling my first non-scarf project very, very easy! There are a lot of counting apps out there, but being able to add text, have multiple projects and multiple counters within a project are all essential little things most other counters don't have (or claim to have but don't work!) Thanks for sharing for Android programming training exercise!
4,I use this constantly! This is a great app. You can track multiple projects at the same time. Also you can add as many items inside the project as you want (I have yet to hit a limit). If you need to link row or rep counts to each other you can. The ability to back up also is great. The Dev is open to requests and also quick when fixing issues. This is a definite must have app for all knitters. Thanks for this app.
5,Very useful application! It has replaced my notebook that I used to keep pattern notes in.
5,Love it I've been using Bee Counter for about a year, and it's been a great tool. Easy to use, very easy to set up and keep track of projects. I haven't used the reminder alerts (I think these are new?), but am going to check them out.
5,Stable; Robust; Responsive developer Neat and simple and exactly what it should be.
1,Never been able to use it Crashes everytime I try to use it.
5,Black background is boring. Well, the option to turn off backgrounds is good, but it's a bit boring to look at the black screen. It would be much more fun if we could have an option to choose our own backgrounds, ex. personal photo from gallery... Anyway thanks for your work, thanks for helping us to knit easier :)
5,Love it! I love this app and appreciate the developer's candor. The only reason it's not getting 5 stars is that background pic. Sometimes, it's hard to read the small print because of the pic. I would like the option to change it or even choose between it and a solid color. I have no idea how hard that would be to code, though, so maybe I'm asking for a lot. Anyway, the app works flawlessly on my HTC One X. Great app! Edit: Here's your 5th star! Thanks for such a quick response and action to my request. Love it!
5,Love this app!
5,Absolutely brilliant I cant remember if I paid for this app, but if I didn't, I would. Its the best counting app I've tried
5,Awesome App! I use this app all the time. Can't live without it.
5,Perfect Just what I need to keep track of multiple counts in a project
4,Great little app! A great customizable app to keep track of multiple counts for knitting and crochet. Simple, but effective.
5,BeeCount I love this counter. It allowes me to label and count in a way that is comfortable for me. Thank you!
5,Best multi-project multi-count app I've seen I wanted an app that would let me have multiple counts going at once, so I could keep track of, for example, multiple cable patterns, increases or decreases, overall item rows... and perhaps an additional count for the other project lurking on the needles. This one does this, and goes one better. I can create multiple projects, and for each one get a blank page on which I can create a stack of counters, name them names that mean something to me, zero them out, increment or decrement... I hear there is a feature for linking counters to one another, which would be nice when counting repeats of a multi-row motif, but I have not dug into this yet. I've only had it for a week-ish, but so far I absolutely love it.
5,Excellent Finally a stitch counter that does what I want without being complicated.
5,Sooooooooooooooo cool! Love love love this app!!!!
