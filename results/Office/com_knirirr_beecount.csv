5,Nice little app, good people too Still loving this program. I can keep track of complicated lace patterns and all the repeats. With the new text section, I can note the pattern and not have refer back to my pattern. Works great on my new Nexus 7. I had a problem with the buttons on my Acer tablet running Honeycomb. I emailed the developer, he borrowed a tablet, saw my problem and fixed it! Love this program. Still love this program. Now also on my Samsung Galaxy S3.
4,Handy I wish it handled multiple simultaneous repeats a little better.
5,Brilliant The first knitting counter app I ever tried - and the only one I'll ever need! Really useful.
5,Fantastic app Absolutely love it - made tackling my first non-scarf project very, very easy! There are a lot of counting apps out there, but being able to add text, have multiple projects and multiple counters within a project are all essential little things most other counters don't have (or claim to have but don't work!) Thanks for sharing for Android programming training exercise!
4,I use this constantly! This is a great app. You can track multiple projects at the same time. Also you can add as many items inside the project as you want (I have yet to hit a limit). If you need to link row or rep counts to each other you can. The ability to back up also is great. The Dev is open to requests and also quick when fixing issues. This is a definite must have app for all knitters. Thanks for this app.
5,Very useful application! It has replaced my notebook that I used to keep pattern notes in.
5,Love it I've been using Bee Counter for about a year, and it's been a great tool. Easy to use, very easy to set up and keep track of projects. I haven't used the reminder alerts (I think these are new?), but am going to check them out.
5,Stable; Robust; Responsive developer Neat and simple and exactly what it should be.
1,Never been able to use it Crashes everytime I try to use it.
5,Black background is boring. Well, the option to turn off backgrounds is good, but it's a bit boring to look at the black screen. It would be much more fun if we could have an option to choose our own backgrounds, ex. personal photo from gallery... Anyway thanks for your work, thanks for helping us to knit easier :)
5,Love it! I love this app and appreciate the developer's candor. The only reason it's not getting 5 stars is that background pic. Sometimes, it's hard to read the small print because of the pic. I would like the option to change it or even choose between it and a solid color. I have no idea how hard that would be to code, though, so maybe I'm asking for a lot. Anyway, the app works flawlessly on my HTC One X. Great app! Edit: Here's your 5th star! Thanks for such a quick response and action to my request. Love it!
5,Love this app!
5,Absolutely brilliant I cant remember if I paid for this app, but if I didn't, I would. Its the best counting app I've tried
5,Awesome App! I use this app all the time. Can't live without it.
5,Perfect Just what I need to keep track of multiple counts in a project
4,Great little app! A great customizable app to keep track of multiple counts for knitting and crochet. Simple, but effective.
5,BeeCount I love this counter. It allowes me to label and count in a way that is comfortable for me. Thank you!
5,Best multi-project multi-count app I've seen I wanted an app that would let me have multiple counts going at once, so I could keep track of, for example, multiple cable patterns, increases or decreases, overall item rows... and perhaps an additional count for the other project lurking on the needles. This one does this, and goes one better. I can create multiple projects, and for each one get a blank page on which I can create a stack of counters, name them names that mean something to me, zero them out, increment or decrement... I hear there is a feature for linking counters to one another, which would be nice when counting repeats of a multi-row motif, but I have not dug into this yet. I've only had it for a week-ish, but so far I absolutely love it.
5,Excellent Finally a stitch counter that does what I want without being complicated.
5,Sooooooooooooooo cool! Love love love this app!!!!
5,Brilliant! Just what I was looking for! This is a great app for simply keeping count of your rows, but what makes it better is that you can also link counts so that you can count increases ie, inc 1 st each end of 4th row, 10 times.. Have tried other apps for this and they haven't linked. As yet haven't needed it for anything else so for me it's 5 star.
5,Great app Have to type out each row individually for my project, but good app for keeping track! developer quick to respond to questions! Thank you!
5,Helpful! Great little app. Love that you can set multiple counters for a single project.
5,Excellent app! I love how simple this is to use. I always have multiple projects going, and this little app is great at helping me keep track. Only thing I would like to see is the ability to change the title of a project and maybe add a note to a count.
5,Brilliant! Love this app! Such a great tool. Love it. Thanks so much for making it!
5,excellent countet nice to have multiple projects going each with unique
5,Great. Simple to use, helped me in two projects already. Easier than finding a pen and more comfortable than row counters sitting on the needles.
5,LOVE! What a fantastic app! Manage multiple projects with multiple stitch counts! I would pay for an upgrade that allows you to set a "row alert", e.g., a notification when you reach row 12 that you should change to size 2 needles. Fabulous app! I use it constantly. Thank you for making it!
5,Great app Very nice and easy to use
4,Very helpful One star down because of lack of explanation how to use it. Obviously I'm not intuitive enough....
5,Exactly what I need This app allows you to link multiple counters which is perfect for more complicated patterns like sweaters with several different cable styles knit simultaneously.
5,Excellent Does exactly what I needed - makes it easier to knit on the bus to work as no need for pen and paper.
5,Bee count Love it!
5,Very useful
5,Love it Fabulous app great to be able to link counts using for many projects not just knitting. Force close issue resolved in a few hours
5,Fatastic!!
5,Very Happy! Saw a mention of this app on Ravelry's Android group board and I'm very happy that I did. It's a great app, easy to use but full featured - I especially like the ability to have multiple counters for a single project, this is VERY handy for things like 2 socks at the same time. Thanks for a great app.
5,easy to use Does what it says. Very easy to use. Amust have for any knitter on the go.
5,beecount Love this app! It's just what I've been looking for. I have all my projects on here. I love that I can put several counts on one project eg rows, pattern repeats, and that I can count up or down on the same screen without having to go to the menu to reset. Great job guys:)
5,Excellent free app Easy to input a variety of information on your projects and super easy to use.
5,Excellent knitting app Good, The flexible knitting counter; space to put any name you want to a county, space for multiple projects. Free, and ad-free!
3,New knitter I must be dumb. This app made no sense to me what so ever. Brand new to knitting so maybe that is my issue.
5,Love it! I've tried a few other counters, but this is my favorite.
5,Knitting. Designer
