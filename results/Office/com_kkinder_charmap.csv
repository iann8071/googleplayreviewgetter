4,Clean, easy, effective Why aren't there more apps like this? Very nice. My only complaint is that I can't selectively hide character sets I never use. It would also be nice if it recognized my system font and hide unreadable characters. Otherwise, an awesome and effective app, free of ads!
4,Very useful Very useful, but I wish it were possible to adjust the size of the displayed characters. They are tiny, floating in the middle of a tile where there is room for a much larger display, and this makes them quite hard to read.
5,Should be installed default Clean, simple interface. Does exactly what it says on the tin, without anything unnecessary.
4,Exactly what it says No frills, spot on target. Lacking the last star because it could use with updating to Holo theme. Otherwise, exactly the app you're looking for!
5,Great But there are a lots of unread character in my phone Is that from my phone ? Or the app ?
5,Simple, but effective. Just what I needed for my random characters!
5,Simple, effective! Was making a list of electronic parts and needed the 'micro' and 'ohm' symbols. In 5 minutes I'd searched for an app, found this one, installed it, selected the 'Greek' section and put the required symbols into my list.
5,It's a must I used to use pc from win to Lin now on android and such app is must to have installed. Pretty basic, just list, pick and copy then pasted somewhere.
3,I wish it didn't close me out of the app as soon as I ... I wish it didn't close me out of the app as soon as I click on a symbol!!! The ability to choose multiple symbols would be nice too.
5,Simple and functional Will do exactly what it says without adding bells & whistles to facilitate extracting money from you. Also, don't listen to the n00b further down in the comments, this app *does* have support for copying multiple characters.
3,It's ok, but happychar seems to be better.
3,Pretty Good... But! -Should be a slide like in the contacts that changes the sets as u slide ur finger till uu Ger to the set u want. -Should be able to at least search by set. -Sets not alphabetized. -Have to keep scrolling and scrolling...
5,Exactly what I needed I wanted a simple tool that worked like Windows charmap and this one does not disappoint.
4,Excellent and simple but... I would give 5 stars if there was simply a "Unicode" or "All" category to just browse all the characters at once.
5,Superb This app has the obscure characters the Symbols app does not. But I recommend installing both. Symbols is fast and user friendly.
5,hope my five start will encourage you to add more feature. like it ;)
