4,Useful app I would love to have the import data option
5,Very Good Better then gnucash in my book
5,Great, it has in khmer Small but portable way to keep track of our expense daily. Especially it has in Khmer. ???????????
5,Solid Functionally solid app. Using to capture and import to quicken. Very good customer support.
5,Very concisely presented Great - presents a huge amount of information on a tablet, despite the 'designed for phones' marking, without pointless graphics or excessive white space. And the basic features which such programs often miss out, such as being able to clone transactions or make calculations within them, are all there. The only real omission I can think of is being able to show the cleared balance as well as the future balance. (Transactions can be shown as reconciled, but that doesn't imply anything else).
5,Useful, simple, well-displayed. Easy to use and to add new transactions. Lots of useful pre-made expenses categories (e.g food, health, salary etc) with subcategories and you can add your own. Expenses can be broken down into days/weeks/months etc so you can see what you're spending on a weekly or monthly basis instead of just looking at one long list of transactions. Can add multiple bank/credit card accounts. Great, simple app. Only shows the black background on the pics above but you can have the background as a black or white screen
5,Simple and efficient UI Loved the efficient utilisation screen space to show more transactions/details.
5,Not good-looking icon ïsçˆçDópGood I think the icon is not good-looking. Will you use the google-suggested UI design? A function of sync with online my expense platform?

5,Simple, usefull, very nice app
4,Great@:@@@@ Great app Easy to use I can't find an option to transfer from bank to cash .
4,Good but messing Bad thing doesn't run if you don't have internet connection. If you can send your expense sheets to your accounting Also if you can give colors to some transactions Also printing will be great
4,Simple yet very powerful Using this for the past 1 month, finding this very useful, simple yet very powerful, missing seeing a holistic view of all accounts and graphical representation of data.
4,Nice simple easy to use Does it have search ability?
4,Very nice Really good.... But would b nice if it has options to change to Indian rupees....
5,The best android accounting app ever I'm an accountant in practice and think this is so good that I've got my clients using it. It makes my job so much easier. Thank you.
