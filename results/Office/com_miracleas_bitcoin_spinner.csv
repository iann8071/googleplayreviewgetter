1,Not working on my Note 2
4,Great way to store and use bitcoins This application works great and has all the important features of the desktop client. I would make one recommendation for improvement to the Transaction History screen. For incoming transactions (ie deposits) miners in pools will see every other address that the block of coins was paid to as well as their own address in the "Sent To:" column. This can amount to thousands of other addresses which is really worthless information to the wallet account holder. It would make sense to filter out all the other addresses and collapse them down to a "more..." button or something so the transaction list does not become so long and bloated with needless detail. In my case, I have to scroll down many pages to see the next deposit information for each mining payout. This has made the Transaction History load very slow and become almost unusable.
5,Very Simple and Reliable Bitcoin Spinner is what all mobile wallets should be. It is decentralized, easy to install, open source, reliable, and has all the essential tools you need, including QR Code scanning and backup export. It doesn't try to download the blockchain, which is essential for saving storage space, and sends and receives transactions quickly. However, there are two things I would like to see in future versions: the ability to sign off-line transactions and the ability to create new addresses. Most other clients let you make as many address as you want, and show you the combined balance of all of them. Furthermore, sometimes, you're not connected to the internet, and you want to send a transaction, and offline signing would enable that. Despite missing those two features, Bitcoin Spinner is still better than all other mobile apps out there hands down.
4,Galaxy Tab 2: My prefered wallet to date My preferred choice of Wallet for a while now. I concur with others, this is a great App but it should have as a priority the ability to be able to change the default transaction fee since prices go up the fee borders on ridiculous. So any future update must have this ability added in, just like a lot of other Wallets now. And yes please add in lanscape and portrait mode, Apart from that its a great App, cheers.
1,QR code scanning does not work when sending coins
5,Best lightweight wallet app Simple, easy to use, FAAAST... and free as in freedom! I've been using Bitcoin Spinner for over one year now without a glitch. Thanks!
4,Need to be able to override the transaction fee With the price of bitcoin at $200 we need to be able to manually set or override the transaction fee. 0.0005 is currently equal to USD$0.10 - which is too high for small transactions, and the problem is only going to get worse as the price of bitcoins rises.
1,Transaction fee algorithm is a ripoff DO NOT USE. The algorithm this app uses to determine the MANDATORY transaction fee will eat any BTC you are foolish enough to keep in this wallet. I had to abandon a .013 BTC wallet because the app wouldn't EVER let old inpits stabilize. If you want to give away money, plenty of charities will at least tnank you for it
5,Great app Needs option to change or disable minor fee. Other than that it works great!
3,SecureRandom Please at least make an update to inform your 5000 users that their money is at risk due to SecureRandom.
4,Landscape mode request! Bitcoin moves to tablets too, so please, make the landscape mode with page-swype navigation between send, receive, address book etc. Looking forward To the Next update!
5,Great Bitcoin Software! Easy to use, light on resources, no blockchain download and easy to back up. My only feature request is landscape viewing mode. Thanks again.
2,OK, but limited My only beef is I can't add addresses without a QR code. Maybe I need a text to QR translator. Or another wallet.
4,Worked perfect till upgrade. Updated and sent 2 coins 24 hours later still unconfirmed. Nothing will send. Previously great app. Update: bugfix. Got all coins back. Upgrade actually made the fix for the previous error that was occurring.
1,Update broke everything The latest version causes a Force Close event after returning from a QR scanning app.
5,Best portable Bitcoin wallet I have found. Works great! I have not found a problem with it. Have been using it for a couple months now. Much better than the competition.
2,No dice. This app never loaded a bitcoin address, just sat there spinning. Perhaps that explains the name. Tried clearing all data and reinstalling. Still didn't work. Oh, well.
1,Poor If you say the transaction fee is a certain price that's what it should be. Period. Not unexpected error bc u want more
5,Light, easy to use and stable Works perfectly on my Galaxy Nexus.
5,Perfect android client. Bitcoin Spinner is very straightforward and easy to use. The private key is stored locally on your device, but the blockchain is handled by the Bitcoin Spinner server. This is a great way for you to be in control your private keys, but not to have to deal with the blockchain download on a mobile device.
