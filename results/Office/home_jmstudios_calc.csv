5,Nice clean calculator Love the calculator, clean and simple to use. I do wish there was a dark theme option.

4,Nice but needs fixing Edited: the new update fixed the issue and now this is the calculator app you should go for :-) more features are welcome Request: one problem if sorted I'll be inclined to give 5 stars. The results show 8 to 10 decimal places. I think 3-4 decimal places is more than enough
4,Great look Get comma separators for the thousands and millions and you have a champion app.
5,Works well As it should. Looks great......bonus. It's a calculator.....and it's free.... What's not to like. Thanks to the developers.....some folk are never happy;)
5,Nice Fast and clean and last update made it look even better on my nexus 7. Great job!
1,Does not calculate correctly. Look nice but does not calculate correctly. E.g. 9*1,9=17.0999998 instead of correct answer 17.1.
5,Useful Typing on a small screen can be tough but this app suits my phone perfectly.
3,Missing separator Looks nice but without thousand separator long number hard to read.
5,Slick Nice...and is open source too :) . Dark theme and history will make it even better if added/implemented.
4,Clean & Elegant Beautiful spare looking with speedy easy to use calculations - nice set of minimalist theme colors to play with.
5,Great Clean simply superb
3,Needs history.
3,Very good UI but its giving wrong answers like sin (30)=-0.9888, very irritating.
4,Good but It can have more features and be better
5,Great app Beautiful and simple calculator.
5,Good looking Never had problems with it and the UI is pretty nice.
