4,An Excellent Keyboard Replacement I do not have a physical imparment that requires me to use Dasher. I choose to use Dasher because it is incredibly fast and intuitive. The learning curve from novice to expert is small. It has is highly customizable especially if you don't mind moving some files around. My only complaint is that the App is not well documented on the developer's website. It would behoove the developer to post a robust tutorial, one which breaks down all the options and their effects on the interface. Also, am in-App method to change the colours being used, would allow users to better integrate the app with their themes. And to the Developer's: Thank You.
4,Pretty awesome. Unique style of data input. While not the fastest method definitely the most enjoyable method I have ever used
3,Good idea but didn't work on my LG Optimus One Tried it but there's a difference between the videos and the real thing, your finger! Couldn't see the letters as my finger was obscuring them. Would it be better to move the "origin" to the left, rather than centre of the screen? After a couple of attempts it locked up (my phone is overcrowded, so maybe not Dasher's fault) and had to switch off to recover, then reload most settings :-( Three stars as it's got great potential.
5,Fun to watch It's like playing a game, watching the words fly past. I quite enjoy writing with it. Sometimes my finger blocks the letters when I forget what to write next (because I get mesmerised). Very rarely need to correct misspelled words which is great (but then it's also fun to watch the time travellesque letters deleting when I do)
5,Fun keyboard I wouldn't use this for when I need to send quick messages.. But I use it for just about anything else. Searching the internet, typing an email, creating a memo, etc. It's a pretty great keyboard. Takes a little bit to learn but once you've got it down it gets easier and easier. Maybe with enough practice and usage you could use this for daily use in anything!
5,Mind-blowing This is more of a game than a keyboard for me, but the concept is simply outstanding!
4,Good but slooooooow! I see that it's best for chaloenged people. For me though, it takes a looooong time to assemble a sentence.
5,Amazing Thank you!!! I'm going to use this program to help my ALS suffering father. This is the ONLY way to input text via eyetracking that isn't painful and idiotic. Perfect!
5,Interesting input method. I've played with this on my Fedora Linux tablet/computer hybrid (testing out other on-screen keyboards)... it's an extremely unique way to input keystrokes. The more I've practice, the more I love it!
5,Interesting. Holy cost
5,Pure genius! And this was written with Dasher.
5,intriguing
1,Verrrrrry slowww
5,Very different, but absorbing Actually designed for use by people suffering from paralysis, Dasher is quite ingenious, and helpful on bumpy roads for this android-er.
4,Good conversion, but the menu system is horrible - there's v. little explanation, ... Good conversion, but the menu system is horrible - there's v. little explanation, and its navigation is inconsistent with the rest of android.
5,Excellent implementation and open source Really very nice, again not as fast as swype for example but I came to this with interested in the used for disabled people and a totally different way to type, I have to say I'm blow away! Works perfectly with HTC Magic/Dream/the_other_one
4,Very interesting. Reasonably fast as well. I always feel like i'm playing a game ... Very interesting. Reasonably fast as well. I always feel like i'm playing a game whenever I type though...
5,This is the hardware dasher has been waiting 18 years for. Try it out!
5,Excellent ive been waiting for the verticle mode.
